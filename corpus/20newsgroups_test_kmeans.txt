} Last night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle } 5-2.  Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate.  He walked at least 6 man in } first 6 inns.  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail.  Clemens struggled with his control, but was also the "beneficiary" of some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were early in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say it?) some pretty good defense by the Sox, including Rivera playing at second, not his normal position.  actually, Clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the Sox almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on Mo's error catching a throw-over.  } I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle, considering Darwin will } faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight.  must win? in April? they've already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this  point of the season... i hope people aren't getting too caught up in this streak; it's been fun, but teams have 11-3 streaks all the time, and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get so much attention.
 Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get--  No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5 Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3 Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3  Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from  the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch  situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process,  you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).    Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any  proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the  caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein  probably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher, but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his  platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into  studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug your local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my wife to dinner once.:-)  Harold
WATCH OUT PITSBURGH HERE COME THE ISLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    They said we wouldn't make the playoffs and we came in third They said the Caps would beat us and they're not going to They say that Pitsburgh has a 1:1 ratio of winning the cup but We'll prove them wrong.   L E T S   G O    I S L A N D E R S!!!!!!!  Bring it back home
I watched the game Germany-Czechs in WC today...and i was astonished about the behaviour of the German audience! The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy! They threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is that stupid or what?? I guess the Canadian referee (one of the Isostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't help much. I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone- But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer) It really pisses me off! I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but  most of them seem to do...
 Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  Consider the following scenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home, but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  It is the balk rule that prevents this from happening.    Believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA (Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario.  I was the batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it.  In the 12 years that I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw.
The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games     that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would     have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin     with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!      However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the     ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break     whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the     deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this     would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.     should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the     N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the     damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to     watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must     let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody     out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.      Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....      Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the     3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was     doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall     to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for     holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about     hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player     had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,     Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that     really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,     on the resulting PP and     eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the     outcome of a game.      They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking     obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat. However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got any.      All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.
[...]   Tim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball.  Deion can be explained as "learning how to play the game".  I'm not betting that Deion will be able to play as well as last year, but I think the odds of Deion playing as well or better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon doing the same thing.  When you factor in defense, Otis was more valuable last year.  But I'm not convinced he'll be more valuable this year, and especially next year. --  Dale J.

    Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there  are any legitimate excuses.    I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal.    In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second  goal.   What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the  game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.    WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times.   For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.                               I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective (and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.
    Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs.  I'm here in a small town in southern Illinois at school.  I'm from Canada and I know that cbc and tsn have games on every night,  all you have to do is go to a bar with a satellite.  I have watched both games between Mon Que and toronto and detroit,  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc.  They show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal all playoffs.  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao.
so. done, career   Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat. He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I believe.   I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance, he could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I think he might have realized something when the Marlins or Rockies didn't select him. The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now. Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen? Ouch.  I'm praying that the BP will return to last year's form....

Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are good in general:    1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and "Basten" are down 3 zip.      (even though there is a possibility either can still win their       series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the       underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).   2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good      enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some      (really) good draft picks... :-(   3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year      the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES?   4. Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques      arrogant ***'s, or are they really?   5. Smythe-what???? I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel      night in and night out... We should see some Canucks/Jets/Flames      action...!   6.

 Yeh,but :  1.Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.L wasn't very impressive. His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs. It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins.  2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their entire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on his head.  Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend. Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major leagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins' flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about 15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics and about 5% are on the Bruins. Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding early.
  I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked, and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock.   Also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that  Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point.  It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos suspensions.    No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).   My cut on things as they stand today:  	(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don't 	believe they draft him to keep him).
To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way they used to.  I'm talking about making the strike zone start at the knees and go up to the top of the letters.  Forget this "the strike zone is in the general area of the groin".  A lot less 3-and-2 counts and a quicker game.
      I didn't say that.  Did you say that?  Wow, I can't believe that anyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter) should get the title for free.  What a dolt that person would be, if that was what they thought.  Incredible.     --
 I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played with the Rangers in the '70s.  This was the season that they put the Rangers crest and "modern-style" numbers on the jerseys instead of the "NEW YORK" or "RANGERS" block letters and two-colour numbers.  He took #77 because the Rangers already had a #7.  (Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the biggest uniform style change in a long time.  This was before Pittsburgh and Vancouver changed their colours.)       dwarf
 That would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on  standby.  If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.    Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway, and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after that, and then I believe he retired.  Anyone else?  --    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carol Boudreau            #44                         a.k.a.

-=> Quoting Bill Gregory to All <=-      BG> hey I saw that game!  I thought the Sabres looked better that you  BG> described. It's Boston that looked weak and unsure of themselves.  Even  BG> if (big if) they (bruins) win the third game what's that going to  BG> prove?  They be lucky!        Well now the Sabres are up 3 - 0 in games, and its to      bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as      that could have been the best series of the playoffs,      I think Boston will come out smoking in the next      two games and that Buffalo will end the series in      game six back in Buffalo, and say, how about those Islanders?      they are up 2 - 1 on the Capitals and will probably      win the series, only to be clobbered by the Penguins who      should eliminate the Devils in the next game.      I cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the       Penguins this year (again) and they will take cup # 3       I'm afraid.  well talk to ya later.   Steve
   How much do you watch and follow hockey?  The Pens and Bruins will be in the same division next season, which will give Neeley plenty of opportunity to whine about Ulf.
[...]  You could be right.  Then again, you could be wrong.  This claim is completely unverifiable and untestable.  I'd wager most of the Braves fans on the net could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.  You could give away tickets to Braves games.  However, my Dad and I were able to get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign of a hot ticket...   This is *precisely* why they were considered America's team.  Even (especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on cable.  You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss the game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too* much worse.  Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia. At home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was as many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990.  You could actually watch the Braves play -- you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds.  I can go anywhere in America and watch the Braves.       Why?  I'd guess that Braves fans are more widely distributed than Toronto fans. --  Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
 I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game" for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans were starting to come up strong. I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events. If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example). But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all) Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries...).  In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.  Thomas
News: ===== For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not  a major part of the team.   Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles.   Thoughts on Game 1: ==================  The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and  try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees.   Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and  sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net.   Thoughts on Game 2: ==================  The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice. The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win.   The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods.   The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury.   The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed 30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil  turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at  each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.  I assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory (MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being a solid seven hours plus from Long Island.  Does anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13? Did Empire demand a fortune for the games? What about the games on Fox37 (or whatever number it is there in Buffalo)? Has anyone phoned to complain (besides me)?  George
  Here are the ones I can remember offhand:       KDKA    1020 AM   Pittsburgh Penguins      WABC     770 AM   New Jersey Devils      WBBM     780 AM   Chicago Blackhawks      WJM (?)  720 AM   Detroit Redwings      KMOX    1120 AM   St. Louis Blues  Are the Flyers on 1210? That's all I can think of.
 This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're going to play  havoc with the schedule, you should  at least make sure that Prime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within one minute or so of the game  ending.  As for the earlier comments about CBC being "Ontariocentric" frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising for six hours of hockey in  one night.   As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.
How did the Leafs turn it around???    I couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA.  Did the Leaf defense wise up overnight? Did the Leafs get in the slot or  was it just "fluke" goals in a goalie duel?  Did the Wings turn off the jets or muscle?   What gives here?  I caught game 1 on satellite.  I figured my Leafs were washed. This is a _major_ turnaround.   Very few predicted this.  How, how, how did it happen?     Wing and Leaf perspectives welcomed!

 ESPN must have some very poor marketing people.  They are only concerned with featuring players (i.e. Mario) than featuring good competitive hockey.   I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence would prefer the Wales stuff.  Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.
  Some comments deleted for bandwidth (God knows, we need it... :))       Ok, Roger, here's a question for you.  Say you are running an expansion team.  You don't HAVE a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up.  Who are you going to pick, guys who have won the most WS rings, or guys who  COULD contribute the most to your team.  Say the Reds were dumb enough to  not protect Larkin, and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo.  Who would you pick?      (I can't believe I'm getting involved in this... :)    John
I forgot to mention that the stats are for games through 4/20.
 I wholeheartedly endorse it.   I have no problem with the  Haven't been to many A's games, have you?  Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason (Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).    I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game (the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).    There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not willing to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's revenue from me.
      How is that possible?  He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year. How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was on his team last year.  After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year, so it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the Toronto Blue Jays.  Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on if they had both been on the same team.
To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a  contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current  heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:  (1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or  (2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.  So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you  were serious, Val!).  ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.  So email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly replying to this post.  Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.
 Stole 300 bases.  (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't think so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff man.  Awesome defense.)   He's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.   Hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer until 1988.   Consistent .300 hitter.   We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.   Same goes for Herm.   Doesn't count then.   Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to 800 OPS career against LHP.   We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.   Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters' parks in the NL.  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this year.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.   Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being weak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six years in the majors.   We'll see if he's still around in 1997.   Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year stretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon deluxe with slightly worse defense.   Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.   He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.   Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.   Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as light-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light- hitting.   He'll have to steal a lot more bases.
  Yep.  And the Ks don't have to denote a slow game, either.  Last night, Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down (14 Ks in 8 innings), yet the first 7 1/2 innings of the game were quite brisk.  He also threw 119 pitches, leading me to believe it isn't just the number of pitches that determines the length of a game, but the  behavior *between* pitches.

 ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players to be shown between plays.  The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile, other times you get burned.
OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:  I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this g     ame locally.  Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!
      Considering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coach's  Corner on Hockey Night in Canada, it would surprise me as well.  But then, people will do anything for money, won't they?
Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad??  I can't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal.  In fact, I think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner.  Now the last time I watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . .   Is it just me??
"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in consecutive playoff games.   If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that."  Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal."  "It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the Arena.  It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks.  The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well.  The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach". The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan to Minsk"  Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.  Just a little fun.
 Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball! (Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*.  I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does too.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people out of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)
  But, Gary, for certain sofa tubers like myself, this is an advantage.  I can watch the Pirates on KBL, the Mets on WWOR, the Braves on TBS, and the mediots on ESPN at the same time, without missing anything.  (If something impressive happens, I'll catch the replay :-) ).  So, I see (essentially) 4 games in 3 hours, instead of 1 game in 2 hours. What a deal!  (Insert smileys as desired...)
Yes, Yes, I can see it now >>>> all those Sabre fans FINALLY taking their Sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them. After 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil I guess it is a pretty good bet.    BUT there has not been a team that has come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 - could this be the year.   (Don't throw out the moth balls yet)

They could put on a Quebec-Montreal game.  Talk a bout areivalry! opps rivalry..  roland
   While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around, Gant wasn't ordered back in the box "sooner", he was ordered back immediately. As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box. Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring drought.  Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something (call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.  But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason to want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old. The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position. Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little slack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key situation.  Did he have a date to get to?  And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game. --  Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
 Ah well, another Brian Sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity during the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time. Yah Fuhr has been awesome so far, but really you'd think Sutter would have learned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season.
Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides Pilon??? Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the blueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there must be someone else!!! Bring back the BAMMER, Dave Langevin!!!!  *******************************LETS GO ISLANDERS********************************  John Scialdone SCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV
 and guess which game ESPN is showing in my area on Thursday - yep, Pens-Devils.  There are so many other interesting series, who cares about Mario???
Okay, the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do, does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility record in the playoffs? I remember that Terry's first year was the first year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under Brian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. Is this trend continuning?  The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh! ____________________________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, "Hey,  let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It's entirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it!"   Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000 level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse.   I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond  me. I only hope they get a new team soon.  Just my $0.02.   -- Ali.
 That'll teach me not to qualify my statements...   OK, something to shoot for.  The Royals will score 531 runs or less this season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the leadoff spot :-( )  Of course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the Royals even manage to outscore another AL team.

     I've only ever seen this called once.  Back around 1979-1980.  I think that Steve Carlton was pitching.  On the other hand, I am not sure how much effect this would have.  It seems that most of the time lost is when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.   I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the game.  Let's be serious.  The relief pitcher has normally been throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  Does he really need 8 more pitches?
But I have to agree.. Boston is a good team..  But streaky...  They put together a great streak to capture first place in the Adams, but for what?  They have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round, and might not make it out of it.  I would love to see the Sabres win the first round, even though I bet on the Bruins (a 12-pack).    Oh well, perhaps I should start betting against the Sabres more often! ;-)
 Michael J. Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the  playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It was quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey player is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993. It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game.   (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)  Topics ------  Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo, Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.  Episode Summary ---------------  Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.  Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They won in their building, we're going to win in ours".  Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk resulting in a goal.  On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells the Leaf players "Don't let them score on you".  Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of instant replay.  On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr. Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his play.  Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's new rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its all hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the problems.  Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article in which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fight because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game."  Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights, someone gets cut every period.  Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported by Murray.
Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday?  It was tight right down to the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played like they were gods.   Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  Their second goal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal player who kicked it in.  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick. Anyways, Montreal is back into the series.
  WHY!!! DC/Baltimore is one of the top media markets (=the only thing the NHL seems to care about these days), they've been doing far better than the NBA Bullets at the gate for the last five years. The team has been a perennial contender and fan support has been good to excellent . . . Why should Pollin move to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro sports. I don't get it...
I agree! Rob Shick sucks big time.  He did the same thing last night's game  between Boston & Buffalo.
 	In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in addition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the Bruins every time there is a conflict. You can also get WBAL Baltimore but I don't think they have hockey. BTW, I once got a station from Indiana that had Fort Wayne Comets games.
Alan "All in all, it's just another" Sepinwall writes...   	I agree.  However, I have to object.  Growing up in the early 1980's and playing 2 years of Mario Mendoza-esque Little League, I was told that since my hitting, well, sucked, I would do best to either "Walk, or take one in the face for the team".  I did both.  And, my Yankee fan father would say, "Bat like Oscar Gamble".  So I did.  And my career OBP was about .550. 	Not only was Oscar a fun guy to watch, but he had some pretty  cool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league players in history.
  Don't let this confuse anybody.  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the Stanley Cup (or even come that close).  These Stanley Cup championships go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century.  The Winnipeg Victorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of them.  Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn of the century??  Lets face facts.  The Canucks are leading the series 3-1.  The Canucks dominated the Jets in their season series.  The Canucks did better in the regular season than Winnipeg.  Who is the better team?  I think that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg.
Actually, I was angry when they went away from the Pens game. Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough.  I only get to see them on ESPN, and when they play the Caps, cause we're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games, so when ESPN switched to the Caps, . . . AAAGGGHHH!
 Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though! It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie Gibson :-)   Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4 starts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.   It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about who wins or loses :-)   I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away. They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.   Good point here.  Chicago's in deep trouble tonight.  The 'Hawks have a bad past history of winning the division and losing early.  When they don't finish 1st, they do okay.
 The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not covered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels, SCNY and SCA, late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage.  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets, there is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus).  With an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated.  gld
Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  I had him in my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a new news reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone.  I must admit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs.
					^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^  Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner. The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on, saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS, USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall. Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are). And everyone gets TNT now.  So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between channels every week.  But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?
 If ESPN/ABC is going to stick with one-sided Pens-Devils series(and it looks like they will continue with it on Thursday night), I'd rather watch pretty women in the stands than non-action on the ice where a slow,aging NJ team being taken out to lunch by a dynamic Pens squad.
It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.  Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it.  The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7.
  I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in  Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional  names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_  will have an effect.  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of  anybody it works on, either.     Surprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all times has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the case, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don't particularly care if it  is an "American" thing either, if it works.
Teemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the Canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause.  Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon.  Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed last year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again.  I'll have to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)
 The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec  defender who deflected the puck.  The re-play officials did not  take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first  non-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial.  I agree that it was a great game; good to see Roy and Damphousse back into form.  Hopefully the sign of good things to come...
So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds  on him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin in return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with his stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles isn't?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies get more liberties than other players?
That more or less says it.  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face.  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to go off on this at all in coach's corner.  billc

I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16, they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.   I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs. She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She then couldn't give me a coherent answer.   Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with  thier sports programming. I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993. The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.  (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)  Topics ------  Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.  Episode Summary ---------------  This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)  Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr.  Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!"  Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.  The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad what they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed."  Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting. However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.  This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who don't know what's going on in hockey".  The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was taught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of just letting kids have fun.  At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks.  Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some good quotes.  I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)     \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,      \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.       \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------        \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the  credit..."          - U. of A.

  a) Dominican b) not all that light-hitting.  .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73 when he did most of his playing.   c) Professional pinch-hitter after that.  Yes, that also gives you Jerry Hairston.   Beginning 10th year now.   Good one.   Not the same thing.  LOTS of people are bad OFs.   Not all that light either.  .750 OPS.   Not 10 year.   10-year this year.   Not 10-year.     Not 10-year.   Yup.   OK.   10-year this year.   *Six*-year this year.   Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith); that seems to be a special class.  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get  more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  And Brock wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he  spoiled his ifetime .300 BA.  And again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.  But if you look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to  be a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon players and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were white.   Light hitting?  199 HR, .793 lifetime OPS mainly with *HOUSTON*? Also Latin, btw.    Come back in 1999 and we'll party^H^H^H^H^H talk.
HELP!  I'm stuck here at a computer in New Jersey and have no access to a radio or TV.  Could someone kindly post the score of the Canucks-Jets game?  Thanks in advance.
     Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly. The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill me in on this info?   A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?   It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city.   Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>               is the best two-way player in the league today.'     There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.   Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion if I'm in a different city.   Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get this off my chest.

 Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach already...and unlike Gil Stein...he didn't get their by stacking the Board of Directors! -)   Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson, a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.

 [detailed explanation deleted..]   Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To  rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance. Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.  Well, that's certainly true in Lotto.  But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball.  When you start down the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.      I repeat.  I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance.  I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance. And I think Chris Sabo is such a player.     --	The Beastmaster
 Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.  The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right.  In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is "Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have: Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271) in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.  So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding.  Total RAR (bat/field)  1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58) 2.

  In fact, he's a complete and total dickhead on at least 2 newsgroups (this one and rec.sport.hockey).  Since hockey season is almost over, he's back to being a dickhead in r.s.bb.
  Yeah I think we're used to it by now. (even if some of us do change our .sigs to root for our second favorite teams :-)   I'll be happy if they win it before I get out of school. (the way it's going I may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long)   I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement but...... by far the worst "band  wagon" fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present). Case in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U. Him - "How 'bout the Pens? The're F-ing awesome" Me - "Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot. Wait until 	they meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start." Him - "When do the Playoffs start?" Me - "Uhhhh. They started a week ago."  I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to  be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.  John Flames >> dev/null Serious comments welcomed. "Eat the Rich"
: That more or less says it.  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw : Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face.  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to : go off on this at all in coach's corner.  And that was the ONLY infraction of this type in the game.  Come on! Wake up! Geez He's not the only player who does this sort of thing. I think we were kind of lucky. The game was not really all that "chippy" considering the state NJ is in about now.
  The goalie to whom you refer is Clint Malarchuk.  He was at that time playing with the Sabres.  His team immediately prior to that was the Washington Capitals.  While he did recover and continue to play, I do not know his present whereabouts.
I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.  Here are the team goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993  These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those are not verified.    If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

(Susan Clark) asks:  I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje, who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL (initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl  Turner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two years ago now.  Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go  and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike  Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those  European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL.  Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years. He wrote a book on his experiences called "Behind the Red Line" (check it out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.  -- Mike
The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:     For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10    minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5    hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).     For all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate    the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have    thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120.    (If the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to    first he would get $7500).  I suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are paid for. Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says "I want 5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses"...
    First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches.  And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better.  Bring back the two-hour baseball game!  (And the three and a half hour golf game with it!)
 Heh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain. I'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast  viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into the Long Beach GP. =)   Were you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day "contracts" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST show that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to have their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business, not your own personal video servant.   Maybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to Dodge saying that "thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS,  you will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time for hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry games (just one example)  Come on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the "big three" overight.
Does anyone have any information about the world hockey championships and specifically about the US team?  Game summaries and/or stats would be greatly appreciated!!  USA Today reported that the US beat the Czech Republic, but that was the limit of the story.
During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr, MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.  Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.  Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night. His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about success.
  Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.  Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he "isn't paid to walk" or "is an RBI guy" or whatever.   I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot.  Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:   			Power			No Power  	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler 			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith 			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck 			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins 			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton 			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost 			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove 			   .			   . 			   .			   . 			   .			   .  	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen 			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston 			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas 			George Bell		Jose Lind 			Kirby Puckett		Devon White 	etc.  As far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the two are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of  target at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example; he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all over the place, despite his huge strike zone.
Charles Hubbert writes...  Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter. However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming back, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line, but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.  Ron
If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated every aspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murray has too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.
Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are  finally moving in the right direction.  They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race  in August.  However, I would take back a few moves:  1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.     I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a     great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year,      but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield     isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?       JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and     immediately have the impact that he has had so far on      the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid     hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be      a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What     about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks     have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years     older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as     before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan      who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take      Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two     promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with     Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling     Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts     only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George     forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that     Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the     Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.  2.  Wade Boggs.     I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is      winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop     a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).     Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about     Charlie Hayes, huh?  3.  Spike Owen.     See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri     or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys     are on the down sides of their careers.  4.  Danny Tartabull.     Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think     about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he     never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,     Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing     left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists     last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.  What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should (at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they  will be ready in a year or two.    I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner. Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep them).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!

 Well, yeah. On the other hand, for the first few years of his career he looked like Herb Washington. Dan Gladden doesn't seem to suck defensively, either.  Yeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career? It's actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a racial basis.  Hey, he plays for Lou Gorman, doesn't he? OK, so it's eight years.   Good point on Cedeno. OTOH, I haven't seen that extensive list of 10-year Dan Gladdens, either. There really aren't that many players altogether who hang around for 10 years even if they're reasonably good.   Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com

 	Yeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers  series, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers  seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The  funny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the four game series if I remember correctly.  - Chung Yang
The Babe and The Pride of the Yankees offer very different renditions of the sotry about Ruth and Gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the hospital.  Can some historian out there explain "history's" version of the story.    I wouldn't put is past either (or both) of the movies to season the truth with a little extra spice.  Any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies?    ------------------------------  Eric A. W.

Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES games where I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of the Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates. His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud. P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?
How about changing team names! Post your choices!  Here I'll start: How about the  Baltimore Baseblazers San Francisco Quakes
 For those of you who complain about Don Cherry, and wonder why he is popular...  the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell.  John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has lost his marbles.  Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or that college with outrageous statements.  Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   Canadians are very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey and curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball and bowling.
 This is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.  For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save: He must finish the game and either 1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck. 2. have pitched at least three innings effectively. A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.   But this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.   This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post.    Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
Last night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle 5-2.  Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate.  He walked at least 6 man in first 6 inns.  But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail.
  I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or kids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game. As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually attends games with me.   I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame, but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours.  As far as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys). If you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening out, then don't have long evenings out during the week.   Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00  for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston,  plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then  I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. I can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a big deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than  I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.   But I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want to have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of two hours.  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere  with my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game.  IMPO.
 	Viola has only played in the NL with the Mets -- not possible for him to have defeated or lost to every team.  Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned in a previous post.   	I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox in his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every team is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period of time) or Koosman as mentioned.  I would also guess that if one of these two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team.  Tom
 I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.  For most career K's with one team, if it's not Ryan, perhaps Steve Carlton. With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.  In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.) Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)  Don't know about the homers/steals dept.  In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  Probably Seaver and Koosman fit too.  And in Randy Johnson's no-hitter, I think it was Scott Bradley, the other half of the old Mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate that night.

AHL PLAYOFF SCORES-- FIRST ROUND	(home team in CAPS) ================================  GAMES PLAYED ON TUES, 4/20 ------------------------- Rochester 6	UTICA 4 Fredericton at Cape Breton  SERIES STATI (plural of status? :) ---------------------------------- Adirondack leads CDI, 3-0 Providence tied w/Springfield, 2-2 Binghamton tied w/Baltimore, 1-1 Rochester leads Utica, 2-1 St John's leads Moncton, 2-0 Cape Breton tied w/Fredericton, 1-1
The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an  Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!  John Scialdone SCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV
On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided  bonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.  People must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S   The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they can't skip the baseball game.  Why don't you people CHILL OUT and enjoy whatever coverage you can get.
   Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but really, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game was the front end of a double play.  Still counts as a back-end perfect game in my book, though.   Congrats to Chris Bosio.  Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him.

 DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry. No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.  (Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)  Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent they raved about at the beginning of last season.  I'm glad to see him faring well for the Padres though.
  Steve Tuttle was traded from the Blues to TB in the before the start of this season along with Pat Jablonski, for future considerations. He played for Milwaukee of the IHL, then got traded from TB to QUE along with Michel Mongeau. He's currently playing with Halifax of the AHL.
Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?   Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him   money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the   league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can   make the big save at the right time.      The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance    against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?    I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance.
Hello,  Could someone tell me if and where i could find faceoff stats for the 91/92 season and later on the 92/93 (i think its to early to get it now).  Thanks a lot
 - - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed - to concern the Oiler's future. - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, - Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. - - As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems - that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if - the team does move, there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman? -    Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The government said that Pock is going nowhere!    Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago?
This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio for ESPN hockey.  	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game  (even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game  going to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said he heard many people say f**K .!#$%.   	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT broadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so  baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.  	GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT!!! There have been to many f****n complainers about this game that it's making me sick.
 I couldn't agree more.  The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up.  So far pitching has been the biggest problem.  Maybe we can get Acker back? :-)   One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse.  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air, waving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's jeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.  I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  He's known for being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been booting balls and playing generally awful.   andrew

 Gant's ML record  Age 28 this season.  Year   G   AB     BA   OBP   SLG   HR   SB  CS 1987   21   83  .265  .271  .386    2    4   2 1988  146  563  .259  .317  .439   19   19  10  <-- 3rd Base Expt. year 1989   75  260  .177  .237  .335    9    9   6 1990  152  575  .303  .357  .539   32   33  16 1991  154  561  .251  .338  .496   32   34  15 1992  153  544  .259  .321  .415   17   32  10  In the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time approx 4.5 seasons.  Just looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF.  His 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF, he began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.  But no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding, he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through 2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF, although not great, and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)  About playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and  speed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have  a GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when playing sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best overall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B is scarce.  Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach hustle.  All that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term contract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and limitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's got some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al.
 bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than mattingly in the future, but that they'll be about the same now is a defensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in the game today.   i'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992 boggs still isn't ALL that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs. however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.   you have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him. however, i do enjoy the fact that "spike" is not a nickname. not that this helps the yankees.   i strongly disagree.  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.
 Not entirely true. A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game GODS and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (small patch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed but I did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in the game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.  There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or another and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copy protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode, compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly compressed), dongles, key disks, etc...  I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection schemes.
 You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life?
 Wow! You really know how to hurt a guy. Guess I shouldn't bother watching any more games. It's already been decided. :^)  luigi
 This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it. Take, for example, Mark McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk:   75% of the time he made an out.   10% of the time he hit a single.   5% of the time he hit a double.   10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4? Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in 227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's *never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be afraid to throw a strike to him?   Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
Does anyone have the player stats for games played up until April 22,1993.
 	John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, German Jiminez, Dale Murphy, Bruce Sutter, Pete Smith, Rick Mahler, Jim Acker, Jim "Break on Through" Morrison, Ron Gant, Andres Thomas, Gerald Perry, Ozzie "The Aeneid" Virgil, Lonnie Smith, Jerry Royster. 	How'm I doing so far? 	NOTE:  I am not a Braves fun.n   On the other hand, ask any  	On the other hand , II like the Braves *much* more than the Cubs.  And all I can name is Ron Santo, Ernie Banks, and Don Kessinger from 1969, my favorite Cubbie season.   	Right.  I've watched enough Braves' games to know a great deal of their players.  I like many of their players.  The only Cubs games I get to see while living in New York are those against the Mets, and they put me to sleep because, face it, watching guys like Rick Sutcliffe and Luis Salazar doesn't put me at the edge of my chair.u   	Actually, I notice a lot of anti-Toronto sentiment here in the States.  Partly because of some of that post-Series arrogance (thanks in part to "Upside-Down Flag" dork posts), partly because Roberto Alomar is about as exciting as Swiss Cheese, and partly because, living in  Baltimore during the winters, I've become so fond of O's fans (especially those who call in to Rex Barney's radio show) that I have to side against their most hated rivals.  	Sorry, but METS is spelled with an "M" and a "T".... =)
  I laugh at you now, and I will laugh at you again, equally publicly, when the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent. I think Bill James put it best (about Sparky Anderson, _Abstract_ 1983):  "There are a million guys in this country with great attitudes, but there are only about five hundred who can play a major league brand of baseball; which are you going to take?"
  I beg to differ, he had a couple 3 hit games after he came back.  He did get caught stealing though.  He also missed sunday's game.  Did he play tonight?  If not, I'm worried.  He's on my team too.
I don't actually have the answer to this one.  Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a "back-end" perfect game.  How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?  The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and retired 26 straight after that.

Don't know who scored, but the Isles (28-7 franchise record in playoff OT games) took game four by a score of 4-3 for their third consecutive OT win over the Capitals tonight at Uniondale.

Have Belfour and Roenick done another disappearing act at chips are   down time?  When I saw them it looked like the Blackhawks' defense  might carry them along way in the playoffs.     Well they held St. Louis to 17 shots in game 2 and lost.
        ^^^^^^^^   In four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen the best player of the opposing team. (In the fifth, the finnish goalie,  Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies  having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy scorers???  Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally (the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago).  Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????   Mikko Wihervaara
I hear ya!  Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and that the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest team in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will lose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they do look pretty good, and they don't even have Sandberg back yet.    CUBS IN '93!!!!!
  There is a fine line between "getting players' input" and "knuckling under to players' demands."  A manager, much like a military officer, needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during a game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time  to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )    Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like demands.  I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm used to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying, "I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role."  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question  like, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?" A more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he is doing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I am all for it."  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.  Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted, except for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that question, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get paid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team."  or something like that.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was hitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player.  Since Strawberry will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help    his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.
Disaster! Finland was beaten by Czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2). Finland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the quarter final on wednesday 28th. Lack of scoring skills has been the major problem of team Finland throughout the tournament. Briza (goalie)  was the MVP of  the Czech team and Tikkanen was the  MVP of the Finnish team.
    Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But    what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid    baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores    to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and     football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid    basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that    was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during    the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..     I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve    by next season...     COBRA   --
Dear Anybody,  I am in Rochester, NY, where people can look at a Rangers-Penguins playoff game and say, no joke I heard it, "Hey whats this, OH, its not even the AHL, its just the NHL, I think."  Because of this e get Red Wings (Orioles AAA) stats and updates but no AL or NL stats.  Specifically Im looking for Red Sox stats so far, Id like all of them, but could handle just Greenwell and Vaughn.  CAN ANYBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!

During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylor went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up on the screen that it was the "so and so sponsored" pitching  change. I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored.  At other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper was setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation that Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation. But what does Charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leaves Duane hanging. Duane's strategy proved prophetic.  These examples happen over and over on radio and T.V. braodcasts making them sometimes very boring to listen to.  I guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name to  Budweiser, Nike, etc.  I don't think it will be long until we hear: "Nike Budweiser drills it deep to left field, Chevrolet goes back, back, it's gone!

     Yes, these last couple of months the Kinngs have failed to show up in about one game in five. Presumably last night was that one game in five.
I really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year's playoffs to me. I mean, the obviously superior Toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing.

Apparently, the public workers' strike in St John's, Newfoundland is over. The strike has, since mid-January, forced the St John's Maple Leafs hockey team to play their home games in other cities such as Toronto, Cornwall and Charlottetown. They have been playing their playoff home games in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Leafs' management said that they COULD return to St John's for the second round.
much Pure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money.  He has been awesome in the playoffs, especially last night.  But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian friend Kymlev (sp?) has also done well.  But Fuhr is the biggest reason they are winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.
I plan on being in the Toronto area sometime this summer (late June or early July) and would like to attend a Blue Jay game.  I would appreciate if anyone could give me information on how to obtain tickets for Blue Jay games.  I would prefer to get good seats and I assume this would require going through some ticket broker and paying $$$$.  Ticket broker info for the Toronto area and/or ticket info directly through the Blue Jays would be appreciated (I'll bring oxygen if need be.)  My schedule is flexible so any games are candidates (though I'd prefer to see Texas.)  Thanks in advance.
 Looks like Bob Errey's ring really sparkles in that locker room, and everyone else wants one, too! :-)  Correct me if I'm wrong though, (just through the net, not through e-mail, I don't need 100 rl's in my e-mail!) but wasn't Boston down 2-0 vs. Buffalo last year?Boston lost 1 and 2 at home and won 3 and 4 in Buffalo.  Whoever wins game 3 will advance.  Simple as that!!! :-)
Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England states.  This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened 28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay tuned.
: Hi there, :  : I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now. : There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers. What does it say ??  ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.  	ERA = (ER/IP) * 9  An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs. Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:  	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If 	an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after 	this error and NOT counted as earned runs.  	If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game 	before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who 	were left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score, 	and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are 	attributed to the pitcher who left the game.  I hope this explains things for you.
   It wasn't Jesus who changed the rules of the game (see quote above), it was Paul.  Cheers, Kent
  Close, but there's a number 3 also:  3. have entered the game with no more than a 3 run lead and pitched    at least one inning.  If a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won, does not get the win, and satisfies at least one of the three requirements, he gets a save.  -Rusty --
 I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the  radar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his  best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went  as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil  Plantier *five* times on the night).  Inky's shot would have gone further than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the  lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced  back onto the field.  That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed, edging out Bo Jackson's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best I've seen personally  (I was sitting under that one).   --- Glenn Waugaman Digital Equipment Corporation Littleton, MA g_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.com
  	  	Hey, Bosio threw a no-no what the hell a Red Sox fan going to say to that. Heck...Remeber Matt Young last year? ICK..
    It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  Have simply been too damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  You can be sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if  the Leafs give just cause.   And let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the subject headers.  I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form of notoriety.  One thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2  games.   --
  I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due.  It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly). Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out" (I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a  veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra (I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history to suit the present.    BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed?   ditto!
  There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans.  Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season.  A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.  The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.   This makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.
I have some advice for you, and some thoughts about your hatred of the Minnesota North Stars:  1. A real team like Toronto would not be moved, you are right,    just eliminated from the playoffs first round! 2. Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in    Western Ontario and actually take classes on map-reading    and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you. 3. Why should anyone love the Stars, when hating the Leafs    is so much better? 4. Oh, I'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my    big words.. next time I'll limit my vocabulary to words    like "get real team now" and "do not waste our time" 5. Respond to this article. I love to laugh at your humor,    even though it it unintentional. I got a BIG kick out of    GO LEAFS GO.... go where?

 Awesome home record or not, you need to remember the 7th game last year at the Aud.  I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB, but I think Boston isn't giving up so easy.

I don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey game, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying "sorry we can't show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not even a game. a friggin HIGHLIGHT show). gee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime. I live in Pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot of coverage.  i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in Texas must feel.
 His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series. It may also be him pressing a little.  As for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford. Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game against Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher.   Good question.  At least it doesn't appear that we are seeing the same Zeile :-)
   I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the  umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.    The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players. I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for having no control over his team.

    [stuff deleted]    The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the  playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the Norris).  It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such  powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was  everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.  Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.   There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone reading this will agree.    We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out, like last year).
 Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to let SportsChannel pick up the slack.  Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S. Support your team; support your game.  Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you won't consider buying their products because of it.
  	You are absolutely correct.  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners.  Correct me if I am wrong, but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give away a ticket to see the Braves play.I  would bet my next paycheck that 80% of the so-called Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. On the other hand, ask any Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given year and 80% of them probably could. 	Granted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but that does not mean they diserve the title "America's Team" 	The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation. 	I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves   	GO REDS!
     Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola.   Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in August.   Those innings were probably helpful.   Well, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly, this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the team's credit.  Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.  Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't earn him a victory.   Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.
Does anybody know what is going on with Lankford? I know he was out for a few games with a slight injury, but since he has beenback (and before the injury for that matter) he has been really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths.  Whereis the Ray Lankford we saw last year???   -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS!!!
I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork, but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move (I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm  talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)
 This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving ESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake.  But returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next time, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.
I need the box score from the April 15 game I believe the score was 5 to 4 if anyone can provide  it for me I would appreciate it....
 No, Boston probably won't go down easy, but if the Sabres hadn't won game one Buffalo would have been out in four.  And what problem are you having with playoff games here in Buffalo???!!!??? There's the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and whatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there's Toronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows.  More hockey than a good chunk of North America, either side of the border.  It's wonderful, and there are thousands of folks who'd kill to be in your shoes, coverage-wise.
Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston. Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series.  Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually, they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey.  Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, "They score, THEY SCORE!!!".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on.
  Someone on the minor league mailing list probably does.    I do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking up specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are limits).   Besides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called the Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I WERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time infringing on their copyright.  Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list (see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should chec out the BA Directory. You can order it from 800-845-2726. I find it indispenable.

     writes...     I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have spouses either.  Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST.  (It was 7:35 last year, but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.) I go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum.  Extra innings could put me well past midnight.  Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all.  If the next day is a workday, I may have to bag that as well.  Further, the later the game goes, the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie.  All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.  If you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, IMPO you are  saying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.

  Hey!  What's this?  We agree!  No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).  Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters, 	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with 	slow curves and change ups.  Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel 	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.  Both players started the game hitting below .200.    There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted 	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game 	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.  Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...  Then again.  If it's not...
It's about time the boys got it together!! They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games. But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that  goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2.  If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance,  but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).
 He's a Canadian "thing". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado Rockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S. and European programs.   After he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada and hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least on playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated.   I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest thing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described hockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get people upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler doesn't.   Don's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial he wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass. But then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that I wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).
 I'd like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team NHL. So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in    fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.  Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on. --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------           I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. 		-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89
 It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season:   Player    AVG AB   Blauser  .367 49   Grace    .391 48   Milligan .400 35   Conine   .375 40   Lansing  .400 50   Slaught  .406 32 Are any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant is Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If he'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next game he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let's talk then.   It's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he swings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when there's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks, but don't bet the rent money on it.   Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience. What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that kind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that is for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad ,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.  There game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo.....                 IMHO                       Pat Ellis  P.S.

ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage and I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It sucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself.  Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game.  Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract        obligations*, screw you ESPN.  Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!  GO HAWKS!!!
Bufflo Sabres has just finished their great four wins over Boston. All Sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players including Mogily, Fuhr, Kemhlev and Lafontin impressed me most. Their  skills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the coach's corner.
 They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait, a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties to Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped out the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at  least the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi Arabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating in favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims), just because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.  So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???   I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the ones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a  leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.   You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough, they have:  	- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom 	  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law 	  brings the death penalty.    	  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?  	- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who 	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on 	  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this, 	  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should 	  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as 	  prostitutes.  	  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've 	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving 	  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc. 	  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want 	  these women falsely called prostitutes?    	  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely, 	  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind 	  anyone who hates anyone you hate.  	- say that women should not be allowed to work.  	- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.  Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among other things.  I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country. But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it sends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that they've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious gatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition. As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud, like they're trying to in the long run.  Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the general west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd) want, Ilyess?
 Probably because it IS rape.   So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even particularly attractive.   Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.   This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or one's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to plenty of documentation...   How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.   Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will "feel" right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness. --   --Adam
 Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.   In Bosnia, "Muslim" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic one as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject:  (1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims     are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.  (2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel     themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.  In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid, and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity.  So, arguments like "yes, but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate. What outsiders say is simply not relevant.   In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when "Muslim nationality" appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing "Bosniaks" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement  of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of "Muslim nationality" choice in census forms.  For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:  Serb-Muslims:                        71,991 Croat-Muslims:                       25,295 Muslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403  This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose "undeclared", in 1953 they chose "Yugoslavs", in 1961 both "Yugoslavs" and "Bosniak  ethnic group", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose "Muslim nationality".  Perhaps the term "Bosnian Muslim nationality" is too confusing for the rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some separate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and cultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general, because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact, Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.

ERGINEL) asked:  [EE] No, no flaming here. Just a simple question.  ...with a simple answer!  [EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox [EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is [EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period.   The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians  in Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.    [EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia [EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.  This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact, Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all Armenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger  society.  [EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what [EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion [EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak [EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian  [EE] consciousness.  The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later  stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to  Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This  practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy  of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these converted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems.   [EE] Any information will be appreciated.  You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry was the word Armenian!  [EE] Regards,

 How about Acts 11: 15-18, 22-23 or, I John 4:1-8 which says to *try* the spirits to see if they be of God.     How do you know?  When have you tried to learn anything about me? --
 Not by any standard of history I've seen. Care to back this up, sans the lies apologists are so fond of?   Not really. Most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. They're prayers and comments taken from the Torah quite out of context. Seems Xians started lying right from the beginning.   My we're an arrogant ass, aren't we?   You're wrong to think we haven't. The trust was in something that doesn't exist.   I'm still willing to die for what I believe and don't believe. So were the loonies in Waco. So what?   Besides, the point's not to die for what one believes in. The point's to make that other sorry son-of-a-bitch to die for what *he* believes in!   :)  Doesn't anyone else here get tired of these cretins' tirades?  Peter the Damed, and damned proud of it!
   No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar.   Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.  Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn't jammed.   Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there, and that kind of thing can affect the team.     Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the right choice was made for that time period.
  What a dope!  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here at a Western University.  Third-worldist and Islamic brain-rot has made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.  The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is well-documented.  In general, Nazism and the leader-principle resonated well among Muslim peoples.  Khomeini's concept of the faqih is a recent example of such resonance.  In fact, totalitarianism is etymologically a reasonable translation Islam.  To be fair, the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of Muslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause actively.  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.  			Last time I heard, the nazis prided themselves in  Yes, the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact -- start whining about the Jews.  What a jerk.   You should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country.  Your brain has no business in a civilized first world country.
And    And Bejing = Peking, who cares about native tongue, as long as we all   understand each other.   Oh, not more than a few feet, I wouldn't think.  I'm sorry IF your paternal   grandparents died in Oswiecym or Aushwitz, which is easier to say than prove,   but if so, the lesson they paid thier lives for was wasted on you.   You are the expert.

I didn't know the man.  Just what the TV chose to tell me.   I thought there were prejudicial undertones here.  I would trust my daughter's   judgement.   I don't believe either side blindly.  IF they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( I   can pound on your door and claim to be the police, will you just lay down and   take it if I do?), then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in   self-defense.

        Let me see if I got this right.  Group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound and after at least fifty years of peaceful co-existance with the outside community (having shoot outs only with each other) - this makes them dangerous.  Prior history would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves.  Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Party blaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers and three-two beer, calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers, Growers and Slaughter Houses.  You want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls be odd balls?  (I know, this requires tolerance for  those that go into Government - but we all know people who have no useful skills.)   ith the death of the children everybody is getting real upset - what about the other 40 plus people? I suppose that you consider children to be property of the state with the family as custodians. (In the States its the other way around - children are parental property.) If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that you send you children into _their_ tender care - I suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children over to their care.  Sorry - I am not as enamoured of the womb to tomb cradle that is IngSoc.  Gotta go, the beach is calling. chus pyotr
Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that "a Christian is one who not only believes in God, but believes God."  After all the name was first given externally to identify those who "preached Christ and Him crucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before God.

Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio) June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers, fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.     Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast, respectively.     Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from campus.     Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.     Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:  Friday afternoon special:  Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper. Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis, and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication. Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.  ---------------- Friday evening, opening session: In Search of the Truth: Finding the Fullness of Faith Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz.

 [...stuff deleted...]  As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put  his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.
 	What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire 	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at 	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they 	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies 	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey 	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us, 	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal 	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad. 	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply 	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant 	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get 	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend 	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction 	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by 	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)  	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and 	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and 	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco. 	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a 	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big 	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be 	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the 	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did. 	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and 	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that 	take root.
  Early in Church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration  of the Eucharist.  It WAS secret, giving rise to the rumors that Christians were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims.  The actions were considered too holy to be observed by non-Christians, as well as potentially dangerous for the individual Christian who might be identified.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --
no   I'd recommend reading _Mormonism and Early Christianity_ by Hugh Nibley,   particularly the articles on Christ's forty-day (post-resurrection) mission,   baptism for the dead, early Christian prayer circles, and temples (2 articles).   ..bruce..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bruce F.

  Diplomatic :-)  I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn't used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see object X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from it's experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's code?  The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called 'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as 'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a 'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  I'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk             Don't believe anything you read in .sig files.

I'm going to be mixing together here stuff from two of Ted Frank's articles, <1993Apr15.143623.25813@midway.uchicago.edu> (which was a response to me) and <1993Apr16.011455.20518@midway.uchicago.edu> (a response to Tim Smith)...   Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party, regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price which is set by the state.  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found in tort, bankruptcy or contract cases in general.  Well, okay, sort of in bankruptcy...  *  *  *  *  *   Bang.  Here's one of the places where we widely diverge.  You believe that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute. _Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party, Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court.   I'd be up in arms?  Why do you assume that?  Quite the contrary, I'd probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air?  *  *  *  *  *   Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights, fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant.  (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-)   "One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with, in order to minimize the transactions costs."???  Which "one" are you speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights. Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational" from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.  *   *   *   *   *   Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment.  As to your "Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made whole, because the award of damages in involuntary" claim, you're at least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer).  In these cases, the "sale" has already taken place and is irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented from happening at all) by order of the court.  In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves.   In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant. There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.   Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No injustice, no punitive damages.  *   *   *   *   *   Doesn't sound very much like a libertarian to me.  Libertarians tend to believe in the rights of individual people, not societies.  *   *   *   *   *   As stated above, the tort was _ongoing_.  Atlantic Cement wanted to be able to _continue_ to violate Boomer's rights.  While the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the _future_ violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell at that price.
         As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the  Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek.          Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.          Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But I kind of doubt that.           The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people, says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces.          It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the door.          There are at least questions that need to be answered.           This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press.           Phill, the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five* minutes.  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would have retreated immediately.          If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying  sub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?          I don't know who did what, but, as I said, there are questions that  need to be answered.
 Maybe before Babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at Babel, God punished us by giving us languages different from the original one. So if that's the case,then angels now would be speaking in the tongue  mankind spoke before Babel.
 The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection. This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other- wise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall, and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least, that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of  marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)
 Like we have never heard of, or read these verses before?  How about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and  places in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals;  what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with  the rest of the Bible.  There are many issues in the Bible that are argued, and can be argued  successfullly from both sides of an issue.  Some examples that come to mind are  		Gifts of the Spirit 		when the Rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation) 		how people should be baptized to name a few.  I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love, even if we are the same sex.  I'm sorry if I am coming across as heated.  It's just that the Lord has been so dear to me the last several years and I'm tired of hearing this same old thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for  themselves.  Check it out for yourself.  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you.  If I weren't confident of this I wouldn't invite you to do this.
  but theology is full of reason even if it is, as we believe, based on false premises etc etc.   hold on there: no meaning to "consciousness" or "mind" or "self"?!   what illogicality?   since when is, for instance, (non-behaviourist) psychology a pipe dream?  Surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the workings of the mind.   "manifestations of the mundane" sounds rather transcendental to me. In fact "matter", "energy", "space" and "time" are well measured but mysterious concepts.   Does an atheist really have to believe in your reductionism or be cast out as not following the true faith?!
hey folks,  I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.  I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.  Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:  1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts.  2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person.  A mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life.  3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe  different) moral laws apply there.  So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative?  respond by post or email.  thanks very much  *dt*  ========================================================
   From psc@sei.cmu.edu (Peter Capell) on rec.martial-arts...    >I'm sure such weapons have been developed.  Our society does not,    >however, condone their possession or use.    Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.  I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose "the authorities" might have been a better term than "society".  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.     In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or    so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-    abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny,     though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a     lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.      IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or     a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-    grabbers' logic.    Agreed.     You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as     important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious     good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities     about something as big and diverse as US society.  My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them.     Or by the    naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause     to someone who would be a criminal anyway.  I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.          Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself    if others' thoughts are not that kindly,  That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to  have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.  I *think* we agree on this issue.  I guess my position didn't survive the transition from cognition to ASCII.
 A search for illegally held weapons (IF there were any, no evidence yet produced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with women and children, either. It also does not justify shooting first without identifying oneself (the ATF and FBI have done this before, so don't say they haven't, please) or producing a warrant.  Guess it depends on whose story one believes, huh?   Which "others" are we talking about here?   "Sub lethal"? Excuse me, but those people are dead!!!   Evidence? So far the FBI has produced none. Don't hold your breath.   Only a few of those being held in chains and s(hackles are wanted .  The rest are being held for the crime of being "material witnesses".   It was not the Feds decision to make, but the firefighters.   This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that "deprive  resources that might be needed elsewhere" it is not a valid reason for not calling them.  Further, since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law, they are subject to the same protection as any other citizen. And las far as I know, even criminals in prison are not left to  burn to death in a fire.   I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you? The government says it, so it must be so? Or haven't you been reading this thread well  enough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story?   Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires, either. Besides, as I explained, some of us here believe their distress might have been genuine. Are you SO certain it wasn't?   There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice  either before of after the initial raid. And self-defense is not murder.   He did not say it was deliberate. Accidents do not require conspiracy theories, only wanton disregard for human life. The initial raid alone (agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce- ment procedure) proves they did not mind killing people.   No one here is "supporting Koresh". We are opposing the illegal use of excessive violence by our government against our citizens. That is all.   A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious views will destroy itself in due time. It is the feds who disrupted the "fabric of society" in Waco, not Koresh. It is the feds who forced a nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel.   On what basis do you assume we haven't? Don't you really mean "It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from history that I do?" :-)   "Militant" implies acts of aggression against one's neighbors. The Davidians left their neighbors alone.  .religious heretics who left to set up such a community  So what? The Mormons were considered a "cult" for years, and were chased out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are advocating. When they finally got to "set up a community" they left people alone. So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith. :-)   It doesn't mean they won't either. Anyway, the whole purpose of a  system of laws is to punish people for what they DO, not what they MIGHT do.    "Telling" is not the same as "forcing". When the police knock at my door, I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI. As for Pat and friends, I don't even WATCH their channel, since I am an atheist. So far, not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed :-)   Right now, the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the  government. And they are trying very hard to run my life. Or  haven't you noticed?   ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    (deletion)     Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. The point is that theism is *a* factor.       That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.       That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.   Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.     And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.       That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.   Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular.       I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here.   An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want it that way.   Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.   what is it you are trying to say?       Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or the way the world works.       Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed) says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can have interesting effects.
This week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on OT, NT and Intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue.  I have refered you to the FAQ files, which I find out, no longer contains them.  They are too long for me to mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the FAQ file.    Because of the renewed interest on this subject, I will type, with permission, an article by James DeYoung.  I think it is one of the best articles that I've read todate from the conservative position.  I can't post it all at once, so it will come piece meal and not daily.  After I'm done retyping the entire article, I will make it available for the FAQ file.  Talk to clh.  Also, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these: REXLEX@FNAL.FNAL.GOV  LEXREX@ALMOND.FNAL.GOV Loren Senders@ADMAIL.FNAL.GOV                                THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING                          OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS                          FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY                                         James B. DeYoung                                Professor of New Testament                          Western Conservative Baptist Seminary                                       Portland, Oregon       Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex, specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to "active male prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation, namely "homosexuals."  More recently the definition "homosexual" has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term "homosexuals" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals.  A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses.  Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline (I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).                        *************************************                                     INTRODUCTION       Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly,  the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.       This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the ministry.
   This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But, at the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak, then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's  qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us?   Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more. The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ. But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.   [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together. First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense, with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't imply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.  Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is a part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth. Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son who was incarnated.
 Well, they never should have gotten into this situation.  Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested ?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant and went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under arrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building.   In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told that they suspected him of molesting children and having several wives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed their story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed. And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing him just a week before the raid.  How would I have handled it differently?   Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything wrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which keep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.  OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for. Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send officers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests. Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason to suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't anyone TRY serving a warrant?  OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to raid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak, and they know your coming. SO what do you do?  Well, change your plans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including sending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I don't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid should NEVER have happened.  The shit that came later should NEVER have happened.  The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us know what the hell really happened there.  The lies should NEVER have been told.  	<MC>
 WOW!  Another Clayton wannabe.  Typical response: lack of logic.  Define 'deviant':  someone who deviates from the normal.  Ok, so far. Define 'normal':   erm, umm.  If you define yourself as normal then it is for you to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question, what are the limits?  For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance ;-) ) 'normal'.  Difficult to prove.  From what you have posted it must follow that `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice. But it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic, doesn't it?   Again an astounding lack of logic!  Wow!  You must define what you say such that everyone agrees.  Here you have used the phrase "sexual deviant".  How in the hell do you define that?  As someone who does something sexually that _you_ don't?  By this definition you most probably mean the majority of the planet.  How do you know that your next door neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then have it licked off by his wife?  Is this sexual deviancy?  How do we know that you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive?  Is  having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy?  Please be more specific, and where you do, back up your claims.  Or I may have to go to hospital due to laughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings.  Secondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means such people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like), I think that your phrase "do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`" (why the brackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments. That is a fact.  Prove it false.  Hence they are a politial group.  You  state that they are not a political minority.  Are they therefore a political majority?  I think you boobed really big on this one.  Try thinking about your arguments.   Prove the first statement please.   Dates, phone numbers, &c.  Again your logic fails.  Again you make statements which you cannot (and most probably will not) maintain.  You state that a person (girl, in this context) who considers equal rights for all humans to be an airhead?  As Clayton (your best mate?) would say: it just shows how screwed up you are.     Proof please.  Proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order. Proof that nature has always asserted itself.  Are you saying that nature is a conciousness?  Are you pretending that you have the ability to see the future?  Are you god(tm)?  In fact, by your arguement, are you waiting for  the black people to become slaves again?  Because they were reviled as sub-human (nb: *not* my view) at one time?  Again your arguement falls on its ass.    Touchy touchy touchy!  Right.  I have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements.  You are most probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers to my questions and challenges.  Since you cannot support your arguments it merely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices, and cannot be taken to be fact of any kind.  I await an intelligent response.....
   I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this. "Christianity is a Higher Logic.  Athiest like u will not be able to understand it.  Your atheist logic is very low.  Only thru faith can  we understand the Higher Logic in God".  So I asked him, "So what is this Higher Logic?"  His answer, "I don't know."  This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore: to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as the ones above and those such as, "How can u trust science, science was invented by man!", only goes to further show the weakness of their religion.  In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses. They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature of their faith. They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.  Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's "reasonable".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement against "reason" above).  --  The UnEnlightened One ------------------+--------------------------------------------------------                   |  Tan Chade Meng    | The wise man tells his wife that he understands her.

 Could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way?  Of course: this is essentially what we do with Homer, or with other concepts such as fate, luck, free will ;-)...  However, there remains the question of whether the religious literature of -- say -- Christianity is a particularly *good* set of metaphors for the world today.  It's also entirely unclear, and to me quite unlikely, that one could take a contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases.
 I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3) something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be. Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to  establish a police force for Haiti.  I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it, nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved in internal conflicts.  That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse lot - the UN (Security Council).  And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a "civilized"  country that they have left behind.  Note I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a lot of hogwash.  --  Srinivas Sunder                                         sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu  If The University of Illinois shares these views, I'd be surprised.

THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 20, 1993       	                             REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT                 IN PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VACLAV HAVEL 	      	                                 The Oval Office  	       5:00 P.M. EDT   	     Q	  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the  Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All  this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision- making process as far as Bosnia is concerned? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most  extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I  think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that  should be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's  not to compare the two examples.  They're not identical; everyone  knows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an  opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against  inhumanity. 	      	     Q	  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more  sanctions on Bosnia? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we've got the U.N.  vote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to  strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are  putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at  what other options we ought to consider.  And I don't have anything  else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on  it and will continue to over the next several days. 	      	     Q	  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any  closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  I have not made any decisions. 	                                       * * *                                	      	      	     Q	  President Clinton, why have you decided to meet  with Mr. Havel? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm just honored that he would  come and see me.  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the  dedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in  our country and around the world, and a very important person in  Europe, and a very important person to the United States.  So I'm  hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic  and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we  believe in.
Thanks for the responses so far. I hope that I have  sparked some thought (which is more my intent than  to restart one of the Reformations).  I'm just going to tug on two threads:  In Message-ID: <May.10.05.07.21.1993.3479@athos.rutgers.edu> db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) writes,    I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community which might be bound by such a decision (I don't know much about the Council of Jamnia, but I have heard that it is not well-attested historically). 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it, and I prefer not to speculate about motives.   I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real dialogue,, but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part. Putting that to one side, Justin's point may be evidential; one would want to know- 'which books?'   Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (MS evidence) they had. Let's stick to the issues. Again, I prefer not to speculate about motives. One would need quotes from Luther, Calvin, etc. to evidence this 'preference'.  ----- In Message-ID: <May.9.05.38.22.1993.27327@athos.rutgers.edu> wagner@grace.math.uh.edu (David Wagner)   Is this the principle: 'Any (BC) text not quoted by Christ cannot be counted as Scripture' ? Think well about this- Job, Ruth...?   		These is a logically invalid *a priori*.   		Besides, we are talking about OT texts-   		which in many parts are superceded by the NT  		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same  		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?  		This principle cannot be consistently applied.  Dave W. answers:    Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it?  If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine  that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_?   If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned before.   This is contrary to fact.   Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality' measured? I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over  Joshua or Chronicles, any day.   What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical.   Dave Davis, ddavis@ma30.bull.com These are my opinions & activities alone  QOTD:
I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it, but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups. I have heard various people (outside this news group) describe *idols* such as power, money, material  possessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I  suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...    I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I  just found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'm not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views on anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good, I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that I could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that every time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in Christ's side because He took the punishment for my sins, when He died on the cross).  In my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is,  but that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary  could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?  It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself I'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about Tongues (I'm reading "Charismatic Chaos").  I guess I'll study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can  give me will be appreciated.      -------------------------------------------  [I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a different tradition than yours.  This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The issue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine. Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants don't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.  I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of course a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and various subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter of how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions, but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd  identify the major Protestant traditions as:    Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between   Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,   Church of Christ  But there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical" perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked.  I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and give a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my library at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.
    just a point, i suppose, if open mind means believing anything can be true or we can't for sure know what is definitely true, i'm happy to not be open minded.  if, however, open mindedness means being respectful and tolerant towards other beliefs, respecting the rights and intelligence and wisdom of people of other beliefs and giving equal time to alternative ideas, i try my very best to be open minded.  just a thot in passing.... :)     not being married, i cannot say too much to you, but from my perspective having mutually exclusive faiths would be a big enough roadblock for me in considering marrying someone.  making it much bigger than it is?  i suppose that depends on how serious each of you is in your beliefs.  lukewarm atheists and christians for whom religion is of nominal importance probly would feel the issue isn't very big.  i suppose the more important your beliefs are to each of you, the more important the issue is.
    And maybe they do.  But without somebody to set the time that doesn't do them any good.   Humph.  Deleted there was my list of non-religious reasons one might want a moment of silence for a dead classmate.  Maybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their pompous non-religious speeches in assembly.  I know I didn't.  So?    Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are actively religious (e.g. actual prayer, "Amen" after a moment of silence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of silence, having the Bible on the shelves during reading period) is not a way to prevent a state religion.
The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having the right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now own it.    	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all murdered by their Arab neighbors - the "palestinians".  	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit "their" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah Tikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs returning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet been able to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.  With all the hope in the world,  Nissan Ratzlav-Katz
Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've heard the passage from revelation:  	"...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes 	 words from this book..."      	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.  	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:  	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were 		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture. 		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason 		to repeat the info.)  	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote 		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was 		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!  	If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere 	around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely 	holding something that is in violation of this command.  	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones 	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I 	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe 	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their 	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D. 		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of  	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all 	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the 	book after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add  	nothing more.
  I never advocated "hiding in the sand."  I'm advocating a peaceful solution while a peaceful solution is possible.  Unless you want blood on your hands.   Read the above.   I type corrected.  (:-)   English revolution-> what revolution?  They never had one.   India-> If they could get around their religion restrictions Mexico-> Point Taken, I forgot about this one.   France-> Napoleon Bonepart would have something to say about this. Holland-> I didn't know they had one, won't comment because I don't know enough.   Actually, I consider the issue on topic.  When you start gambling with fire crackers, sooner or later, somebody is going to lose a hand.   Fine.  Exercise the right to free speech.  That's great!  But don't resort to armed violence until there's no other possibility.   No.  I believe there are bad cops, and good cops.  There are bad people, and good people.  (And all that grey inbetween.)    I have had the pleasure of knowing a police officer who did his best to uphold the laws he swore to defend.  I have also seen what happens when police power is abused.  Don't generalize in either direction.  It just causes problems.   Me either.  Nice can of worms, ain't it?
 That's right.  Everyone.  Even infants who cannot speak as yet.  Even a little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket. Even a little child will not want his diaper changed.  Even a little child will fight nap-time.  So far as Jesus saying "everyone":        A certain ruler asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do to     inherit eternal life?"      "Why do you call me good?"  Jesus answered.  "No one is good--     except God alone."  Ken, the book of Romans states that we are born sinners.  We do not grow into being a sinner.  We sin because we are sinners.  The common mistake, even in Christian circles, is to think the reverse true.    So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents, you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature. It goes with being human.
  I quote from the journal, "30 Days In the Church and In the World," 1992, No. 8/9, p. 29.   Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:  	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise 	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot 	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of  	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties, 	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar 	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede 	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's  	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will  	continue to be expressed in the  	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the 	effective means for preserving public order and personal 	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death 	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the 	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred 	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the 	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.    As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.     I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question of faith or morals arises.
 I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not. Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.  Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.  Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience.  Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.    Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11.   But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?     >  Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God, in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of God puting them into his new order, and not a question of"personal" faith as such.   But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death, because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.    While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is  what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have.   But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was  passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in baptism today.
In <1993Apr24.214843.10940@midway.uchicago.edu> eeb1@quads.uchicago.edu   I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a "moment of silence" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of "allowing" for religion amongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this.  There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this "moment of silence" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer  being able taking note of it.)  A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant "mainstream" religion.  All that a "moment of silence" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it, to have a "special" place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the "moment of silence" it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.  Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians.  As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this "moment of silence" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in "making" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so.  If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you.  Give it up.
  	The "R Us" is not trademarked, but the "Backwards R Us" is, I  believe.    ---    Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a   term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, "God must exist, because   he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really   doesn't!"  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological   proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among   others?
  What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners, promising to execute Rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the Iran/Iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc Christians in Egypt, massacring Christians in Sudan, harassing Christians in and  barring Jews from Saudi Arabia?  How are paranoid Muslims "righteous in defending themsselves" in these situations?  Who are they even afraid of?   Considering that you seem to be posting from central New Jersey, this is an odd comment coming from you.  I dare you to speak your mind in the Middle East in any country besides Israel.
Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives.  I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet.  Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."  Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?  I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example, consider the saying in Matthew 6:24   + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one  + and love the other, or....  Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take second place. In our original example, second place means that Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist:   + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.  I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (John 1:21).
Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I've often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"      was behind the universe's existence.  I've      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I've known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they've kept this belief in some form of higher      "being."  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the "right" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."      Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and      "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he's been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God's existence and question it impartially?

 I don't have a stat, but, unfortunately, I did read generally that both smoking and belief in the supernatural (occultish garbage) is on the rise here.    This is very interesting.  I thing the principle is sort of the same though: all "philosophical" ideas are generally tried out and tested mostly during college years.  Whether the idea is christian or atheist doesn't always matter. But I'd like to say it's because atheists are more intelligent  :)   --   regards,  --Adam
   "Muslim" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?) exist in ex-Yugoslavia "Christian Muslims."  Tito defined the Muslim  nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally: Montenegrins, and Makedonijans.   Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, "Muslim" is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who  differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not  a "Christo-Slavic" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it was the "Atheist Communist" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.    The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all* chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.
 Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of Christianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin in order to learn about salvation.  BTW, your statement would also eliminate about 99.5% of all the Christians in the world, as well.  Cheers, Kent
Robert,  I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've  been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med. I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just  like I haven't read "The Yeast Connection").  Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of  recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually  left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a  review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually  proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.  Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay  texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food  combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent  oxidative damage in the body).  Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove  that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you  use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees  I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in  commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this  kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I  couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really  guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is  that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to  produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so  they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.   Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and  in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve  fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we  really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with  silicon?  Not in my book Robert.  Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation  that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon  based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I  know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to  separate the fiction from the fact.  Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in  humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing  there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know  about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not  because silicon is transformed into calcium).  Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective  tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show  that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective  factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin,  the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity  which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as  part of the ageing process in humans).  For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which  calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon  in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the  bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming  cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in  the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of  defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also  another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an   undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not  transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing  observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into  calcium is an interesting little trick.  But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and  yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without  a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group  are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any  better).  If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base,  I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources  that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems  to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm  going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us  kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.  For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's  interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric  neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his  name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in  our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with  brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one  case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional  treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the  cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between  radiation treatment and surgery is guys?   I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the  chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which  do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it  because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your  sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).
  there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents.    Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.    My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  Overall, I thought that I had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were useful.      Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between 1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the "statistics".        Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over these children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is would not let innocent children die. If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive?  Thanks for the reality check Joe, its been real.
  I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).
  	May I ask why they are afraid to do so?  ---    Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a   term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, "God must exist, because   he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really   doesn't!"  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological   proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among   others?
Hi everyone,  I'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand how to listen.  Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but I have a few questions.  1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her you go, I'm committing my life to you", I wouldn't really feel that he'd listened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to God?  2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what do I have to give up?  3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if any) burdens am I taking on?  4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume, that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?  5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!  Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.
Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God and His Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.  There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding "circumstance of revelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an. The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  "...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an....".  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic verses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the "The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied: "By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.   I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup. Unfortunately, I do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like soc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?
mcsdc1jpb@dct.ac.uk (John Bell) babbles from Scotland, one of England's last remaining colonies:    People who were dumb enough to believe Klinton was a moderate deserve what they get too.  It's a real laugh to hear them try to justify this massacre with bullsh*t about how concerned they were about how our tax money was was being spent.  (Wasting money keeping Texans alive?  Hell no. let's spend it to import Haitians with AIDS so we can treat them at taxpayer expense.  %^P  )   So what?  The Feds killed 90+ civilians when they "ran out of patience", to use their own phrase.  If the Feds hadn't attacked them, they'd all be home eating  dinner with their families tonight.  Too bad, but they started it.  Maybe next time they'll think twice.  That's worth 4 stormtroopers.   Nobody says he is.  What he was was a victim of a left-wing government, that violated its pledge to protect and uphold the Constitution, run amok.   Don't worry, though dweeb, we're gonna take it back.  (Hey, I'm a white guy, but would it be OK if I quoted Malcolm X here, and said "by any means  necessary"?  Nah, never mind.  We can do this legally...   NO, you're just a brainless f*cking trogladyte.  Go beat up some soccer fans.  Ignorance is bliss, so drool on with that stupid smile on your  face when people die needlessly. I hope a badger climbs up your kilt.  (Don't expect these UKies to care about this, folks...  these bastards never did like the idea that we Americans had the means to defend ourselves  and wouldn't stand for tyranical governments, which is why we sent them packing  back to their dreary little island with their tails between their legs twice.)
    No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an  Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, "The Armenian Community", pages 97 and  105. Atamian quotes:   "... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and  tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of  the Party, was to be attained by:        1. Oral and written propaganda.       2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure          of self defense.        3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be          equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared          for a general uprising.       4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with          each other and subject to a central body.       5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters."  Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:   "... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?  By:        1. Propaganda        2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination       3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people       4. The arming of the people       5. Organization of revolutionary committees       6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with          the official bodies and journals       7. Organization of financial zones for public collection        8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government          officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors       9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry      10. Building of roads for the transport of arms      11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions."  Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people  were committed by the brainwashed members of the "Tzeghagron", namely,  "race-worshipers" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again,  Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh, in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).  Serdar Argic
  That would be nice, but considering professional diplomats between Israel and Athe Arabs have been unable to do so for 45 years, I can't see us starting. But hey - as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a  scholarly manner, count me in.  Anyway the responses were mostly negative and I've been  People have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what  you say - if you say, make it factual and be able to back it up.   Thanks for teaching us about the civilized world, Andi.  I guess we all just  came out either the desert or the ghetto, right?  And no, we are not paid Israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the ZOG - we are just people who believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing or disloyalty due to our love of Israel (disguised as "paid Israeli lobbyists" - what kind of image is that?)    Oh!  Thank you!  I needed your approval of my heritage.  I guess I can go home and feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that Jews _really_ aren't worse people than anyone else, contrary to what we all _know_ is true.
  Ofranko. Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a  self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should  take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the  obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of  the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be  studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the  horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic  homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied  by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up  the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory  to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime  of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making  reparations to the Turks and Kurds.  The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. Still denying the obvious?   Source: Stanford J.

"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days."  "Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves."  "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies."

"...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final  plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the   president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:   'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the    glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian   arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the   Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining   under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey   who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new   free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]  Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the  area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as   ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work   of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead."

    I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.    A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con- ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have my own shotgun in my apartment.    Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no, I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.    It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.   Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this) to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.    I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever  bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons, and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway.  If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per- verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something in their state.  semper fi,
 once upon a time, that's exactly what they would have done & everyone could have just gone on living a peaceful (if well armed) life. what is it that makes people think they have the right -not- to just leave others be?  jason
  And from whence does this right stem, that it overrides the 'rights' of the rest of us?   And if you want to view that television station, you have to watch the commercials.  You can't turn them off and still be viewing the television station.  In other words, if you don't like what you see, don't look.  There is no 'right' I can think of that you have to force other people to conform to your idea of aesthetic behaviour.  What's next, laws regulating how people must dress and look so as to appeal to your fashion sense, since you have this 'right' of an aesthetic view?      Which has what to do with the topic of discussion?    Oh, I see.  You don't want any legislation that might impinge on you; you just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want.  --  "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,  often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not  something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the  stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so  strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and  do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even  believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build love.  In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our  neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he  commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love  with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to love someone is to pray for them.   - Scott
 I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams,  or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign  that he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a  pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy even when he dreams.  Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.    Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be careful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else. Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE might actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE. In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught up into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters that much.  Paul could not tell.    Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan to experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a  place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His own sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are just taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking an OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was caught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one time.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it. People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits for the sake of a few thrills.
[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]  R. Scroggs       Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a "Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology."  The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male").   Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid "contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks (108).       Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's "learned discussion" (107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a male" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9), which Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the active partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109).      This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The combination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave dealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of pederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121).  Even "serious minded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1.  Consequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122). We cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122).       In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item in the lists" (104).        Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a "catalogue of vices,"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are "irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129).  The "model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . " (127).        REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI  D. Wright       In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "Apostolic Constitutions,"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28).  Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps with a male," making arseno- the object.       Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender" (132).        It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources.  For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).        Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia ("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit adultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with boys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43).       Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).       Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.       Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be absent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41).        Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention (141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright observes that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world.        Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning "homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited conclusion based on them.       Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).       In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and others who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies.
 Muslims helping the Nazis???  Where on earth do you come up with such accuusation??  Do you have proofs??  If not, you should publically apologize for such a statement.  Last time I heard, the nazis prided themselves in needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies.  And if your statment were true, don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim neighbor (PALESTINE) could do to them if they allowed it to be?  The jewish lobby and power is very strong, and if what you said is true, we would of heard it from them before you could come up with it. And you dare say that you are taking no sides!!
 I certainly agree with the last paragraph.  Also, Jesus;s statements on hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as was much of his other teaching.  There's more than enough hell here on earth that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter to me.  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift God offers.  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --

As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not  necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific  fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague.  The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there  explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

 I would put it stronger than that.  I consider it nonsense.  Simply put, I do not see any way that a "Platonic essence" could have any *real* existance.  "Essence" in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways.  So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence', thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.  Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.  --  sarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima)   or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com
 Parts of Sen. Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:     Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak    diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you    my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to     participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.    ...    What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,    timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.    ...    After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us    to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the    right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe    havens' for the Bosnians...    Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and    religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say    that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims    were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression    instead of Serbian aggression.  Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which  pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin to predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:     I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear    this is a big deal... so they will understand.  and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have  aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a "divide-and-conquer" game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression)  to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.  One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has said in Rome last week that "In practice, the embargo had the opposite effect intended.  It made aggression certain."  All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy.

THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 20, 1993       	                             REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT             IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRESS                               The Rose Garden   1:36 P.M. EDT 	      	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal  agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law  against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled  weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.   Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day  standoff ensued.   	      	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every  reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without  bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were  ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were  dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably  insane.        	     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both  federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,  responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the  action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination  towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no  provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal  agents against the compound.   	      	     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on  an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on  Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.   The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even  in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause  permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people  in the compound to come outside and to surrender. 	      	     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I  discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I  thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what  she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the  implementation of the decision.   	      	     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.   Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal  agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his  captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not  survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate  responsibility for the carnage that ensued. 	      	     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the  future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and  Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to  uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been  done differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent  professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I  expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required  to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to  cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can  continue to be fully accountable to the American people. 	      	     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney  General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the  front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult  circumstances.   	      	     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry  for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end  of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be  tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David  Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over  the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult  situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will  be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future  will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what  has been learned now. 	      	     Q	  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,  after 51 days, you decided -- 	      	     Q	  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is  that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation  with -- 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go  first and then the other. 	      	     Q	  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno -- 	      	     Q	  Mr. President -- 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I  can't do it at once. 	      	     Q	  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about  the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General  that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another  step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she  described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted  to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause  permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it  very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was  hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.   	      	     I was further told that under no circumstances would our  people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to  shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and  there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful  lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.   There were no shots coming back from the government side. 	      	     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I  asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons  I was given were the following: 	      	     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the  federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the  quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be  needed in other parts of the country. 	      	     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had  never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced  that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to  be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult  members to come out.   	      	     Number three, that the danger of their doing something  to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with  the passage of time. 	      	     And number four, that they had reason to believe that  the children who were still inside the compound were being abused  significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and  unsafe conditions. 	      	     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.   The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had  given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and  evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said  that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were  convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only  increase with the passage of time. 	      	     The third question I asked was, has the military been  consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,  that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious  that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military  people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some  of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the  military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they  had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one  minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military  -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming  significance. 	      	     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I  said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she  should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that  today. 	      	     Q	  Mr. President -- 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead. 	      	     Q	  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were  trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only  reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only  reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to  add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather  late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who  had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into  custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events  to unfold.   	      	     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people  speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General  on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.   I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry  King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it  is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that  happen when the federal government is in control. 	      	     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised  would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the  Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics  murdered themselves.  (Applause.)   	      	     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this  life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These  people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were  heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,  and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to  avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate  themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the  children.   	      	     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,  is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you  to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why  you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she  said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those  children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly  unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier  with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for  that.  So that is where I think things stand. 	      	     Q	  Can we assume then that you don't think this was  mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of  patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really  decide that way? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume  is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has  done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of  time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the  World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry  to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we  should have known?  Is there some other question they should have  asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say  for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make  the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want  the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have  some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but  totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best  evidence we have.   	      	     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of  fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it  again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,  particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is  important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the  people who killed others and then killed themselves. 	      	     Q	  Mr. President, were there any other options  presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from  February 28th until yesterday? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all  along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go  back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good  job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued  any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them  early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of  the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to  be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the  authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things  just began to spin downward.   	      	     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened  yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not  involve other options except whether we should take more time with  the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they  wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get  people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.   That's what they thought. 	      	     Q	  Did the government know that the children did not  have gas masks? 	      	     Q	     congressional hearings once the situation -- are  you in agreement with that? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do  whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the  Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring  in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any  congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully  cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the  most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the  country. 	      	     Go ahead, Sarah. 	      	     Q	  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The  first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not  have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance  because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was  very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived  without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't  those people have a right to practice their religion? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their  religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had  violated federal laws, any number of them. 	      	     Q	  What federal laws -- 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't  answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the  whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they  were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but  it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of  the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of  this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were  speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that  the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have  escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.   	      	     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground  compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be  sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if  the children were not released immediately outside that the humane  thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace  where they could be protected.   	      	     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned  yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas  was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks  themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they  all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a  nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. 	      	     MS. MYERS:  Last question. 	      	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying that -- 	      	     Q	  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked  Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you  learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your  mind during those horrendous moments? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had  considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the  public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that  the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues  concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would  be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in  the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were  right or wrong, of course, we will never know.  	      	     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the  building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate  concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were  escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.   That's the first thing I wanted to know.   	      	     Thank you. 	      	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a  Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision? 	      	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't  have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't  go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I  take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I  signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to  make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had  elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,  if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.  And I do support her.   	      	     She is not ultimately responsible to the American  people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an  appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as  well as she could have.   	      	     Thank you.  (Applause.)
-*----  Far from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who "tosses out" the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly.  Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text.  I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes any sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as telling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite author's history of whatever.)  Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The modern American history textbooks that whitewash "great American figures" are historical evidence.  These are all historical evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "great American figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe "saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy to read.  Give it a try.
 Well, it seems we don't learn the lessons of history do we?  I was hoping that Kent State taught us a lesson.  Apparently not.  Apparently the government will murder anyone they choose to still.  --- Rawlin Blake    blake@nevada.edu
     In other words, the right of might.    In other words, the right of might.     In other words, he can do it, he did it, and your in no position to argue about it.        In other words, you better do what this God wants you to do, or else!
 Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life recently.  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own, since He is both within and without it.  Using words like "foreknowledge" and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no "before" when He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or a time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  In fact, since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with God's control of the universe.
  Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we can ask: 1. Is it authoritative? 2. Is it prophetic? 3. Is it authentic? 4. Is it dynamic? 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?  On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling.   But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead body' that it was included in the catholic canon.   How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.  It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.   I am not familiar with the book.  Some other arguments you might like to consider are found in Chapter 3 of Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands A Verdict.

I can accept every   word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques   being razed.  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques   were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing.  Too well we   know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten   the Temple Mount riots, when the Moslem crowd was led to believe   that the Israeli Guards were there to cover for the TMF instead of   stop them?)
    Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the Catholic Church.  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is considered to be God or part of "the Godhead."  Therefore it implies no such thing about the feminine in general.     Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was announced "out of the blue."  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the Assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.
  There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians. The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument. The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).    6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.   7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.  According to Karakashian:  As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians, this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.    Saint Martin:  The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye.   Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror,  while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and  therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.  G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary "Haik" is the diminutive form of "Hai", and that "Hai" is the name of our nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word "Armen" that foreigners apply to our people.'  It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is  the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai'.  Haik and Haiastan:  Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and, in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren.  Haiasa:  The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the  region known as Armenia.  Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'  Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.  Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with  no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.  The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.  Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older works.  According to Karakashian:   'The word "Haik" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it ever found employed in the forms "Haika" or "Haykazn".  Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from "Hai" or "Haik" they could  also have used the words "Haikak" and "Haykazn" in a number of places.'  According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite  inscriptions:  'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. The words "Haddanas", "Haddina" were used by the  Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the "d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "Hadinasdani" was in this way transformed to "Haiastan"'.  Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a  solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa'  which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards. Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.  E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological  and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.  The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark, above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.  According to J. Deniker:  From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are  descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of  85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family.  Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:  The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols, but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth.   Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a  distinct race.  Serdar Argic
     Actually Judea and Samaria are proper geographical names, just like      Asia Minor or Lake Michigan. Judea and Samaria are even used in      an atlas published in (what used to be) USSR circa 1970 that I have at     home. The government of the USSR was of course quite hostile towards     Israel and would hardly engage in a pro-Israel propaganda. I would be     willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to Mr. Schmidling      with relevant words underlined to simplify his search, if he promises     to report to the net afterwards.  Mr. Schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this general rule. For although he is almost without peer in both the number of lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them --- he hasn't  found many people who believe his lies (yet ?).
Let's discuss Reno's taking full responciblity. Is everyone happy with the  outcome? Did the FBI pursue the correct course of action? was justice done? If Reno really meant what she said she would resign! She is just grand standing, period. What did those people do wrong in the first place? that is what i can't figure out. sure they were crazy, no dought about it, but what did  they do wrong? someone please help me out on this.
  How wrong you will be.  I participated in the last National March on   Washington (MOW) for LesGayBi rights (Oct 11, 1987) - with a turnout of   about 750,000 people - and we didn't have alot pissing us off at the time.    The big issue was the AIDS crisis, but we weren't being slapped around   quite as bad as we are now.  This time its AIDS, and Equal Rights,  and   the Military Squabble.  And this MOW has been in the planning for YEARS   whereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time.  The   last MOW was the largest ever on D.C. and you can bet we are going to   exceed that by a long shot.  I truly believe we will exceed the 1.0   million goal the MOW committee has always had set for this event.

  Armenians have been doing just that for a long, long time.  Source: "Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at Munich Olympic Games," The Armenian Reporter, February 7, 1985, p. 1.  "Le Matin, the influential Paris daily, based on unidentified sources, claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian, the founder and leader of one faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games...  Le Matin added that up to 1982, Hagopian operated out of Beirut, Lebanon, but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force, although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus, Syria, and Athens, Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the Armenian underground leader with "open arms" and still providing him with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey.  Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause, with the rest  coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in drug trafficking."

  Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle it.   It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.  Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been  more effective.  The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they  just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?  If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff.   The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have  been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted to arrest their former ally.    Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out  thought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to employ.  Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole core of the question. Everything else is a diversion.

    searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the    ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and    eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through    Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people    who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime,    so we are making it possible for Christ's saving grace (I know there    are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully    effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side.   This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Hammerslag (dhammers@urbana.mcd.mot.com)    "...there ain't nobody so bad that the Lord can't save 'em ain't         nobody so good they don't need God's love..." -- Mullins
         Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like         me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in         the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen         the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.          We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and         ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the         objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's         everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any         time they actually go after somebody just because they don't         like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often         blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed         Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme         Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to         Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).          Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of         it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we         have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the         War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional         powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more         arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the         War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop         fighting each other long enough to do any really effective         suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our         Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend         off a bent cop.          It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and         the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,         while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government         is getting in-your-face liberty.

  And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims  with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in  various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian.  14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army  units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1]  A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France, Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that  "Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion  Armenienne.'"[2]  That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

[2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian      Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19.  In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed, to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the  second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created. These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were the field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers. Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours  red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces, hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim  population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

    	Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are based on power.  They are also based on favors owed, coalition building, and deal making.  While this may have a racist element to it, I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the "old boy" nature of politics.  Now, I'll freely admit that the old boy system has racist and sexist effects, but I don't think that those are its purpose, whether in the US, Israel, or elsewhere.    	Here again, you miss out on the old boy nature of politics, and the existance of back-room deals.  As individuals, these arabs may not be as well connected as the Jew who gets the job.  I don't like this aspect of politics, but I understand it exists.  Adam   Adam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
  This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the "deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just dictating his translation to an amanuensis.  That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the first steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have) among the Greeks.  Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" these books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these ALONE.  I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek) are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow "more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable -- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current "inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of course, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.  BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome, above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two of four have been published so far.
  I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others may not have the reference.  "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents."  What is "the sin" of the parents?    Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle. However, it assumes that fathers and sons have  equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.  Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their  children, the parent would be held responsible -- not for their children's sins, but for not teaching them properly.  Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position  of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge.  In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others  is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel." "If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from  his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to  turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."  Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with "parents have children in Zion" I believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children  whatever good principles they understand. However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly.
     There are exactly ZERO verses that "clearly" address the issues.   The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.   The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or "reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas.  Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly "harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]  	"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything 	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one 	will not let anything make free with me."  [1 Cor. 6:12]  Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.  I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and which ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.  I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law?  For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you "pick" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything." But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this context, it is remarkably offensive to say:   Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality.  It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so.  Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.  Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is.  Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.  Why, for God's sake?  	"For God did not send the Son into the world 	to condemn the world, 	but that the world might be saved through him. 	Whoever believes in him is not condemned, 	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son. 	Now the judgment is this: 	the light has come into the world, 	but men have preferred darkness to light 	because their deeds were evil. 	For everyone who practices wickedness 	hates the light, 	and does not come near the light 	for fear his deeds will be exposed. 	But he who acts in truth 	comes into the light, 	so that it may be sh0own 	that his deeds are done in God."	John 3:17-21  For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.  However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us.
I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I just wanted to add a point.     The whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution provides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague, something I know little about.
    Not according to reports I have read. It seems that the Somalis think of our African American Marines in less than complimentary terms, using gestures that signify a word I refuse to use. Seems that even when you try to help people, they still insult you.
People who criticize "big Government" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.    (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn't it?)  But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money.  Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.    It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools.    -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368

 Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has.  Let's consider some "personal interpretations" and see how much trust we should put in "Orthodox Mormonism", which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.          In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they "thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah." He also said Christians are wrong to believe "that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity [God the Father]," and that Christ "came into mortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that "Elohim is the Father" and "Jehovah is the Son."    "Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the   Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As   with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the   Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy   Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was   born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.   (Promised Messiah, p. 100)          Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their "three-in-one God" and their belief that "God is a Spirit" as they are in their understanding of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. Before examining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words "Elohim" and "Jehovah." McConkie stated:    "...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in   the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the   exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)    "_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted   name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon   Doctrine, p. 224)          Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:    "_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus   Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn   Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,   Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve" apostles of the Mormon Church states that "God the Eternal Father...[is] designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..." (Articles of Faith, p. 466) "...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state...was known as Jehovah..." (Articles of Faith, p. 471)          Today Mormon leaders teach that "Elohim" in the OT refers to God the Father and "Jehovah" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians for saying "Jehovah" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two "name-titles" should not be changed around so that Christ is called "Elohim" and the Father is called "Jehovah." "...the Father...is Elohim, not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one and the same person." (Promised Messiah, p. 111)          In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word "Elohim" is used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges of Israel. When referring to the true God, "Elohim" is translated with a capital "G." When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel, it is translated with a small "g." It is translated four times as "judges" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as "judge" (1 Sam. 2:25), twice as "mighty" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as "angels" (Ps. 8:5), once as "godly" (Mal. 2:15), once as "great" (Gen. 30:8), and once as "very great." (1 Sam. 14:15)          The word "Jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word "Adonai."  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since "Jehovah" rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use "Jehovah" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name. "Jehovah," unlike "Elohim," is never used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible. In the KJV, "Jehovah" is rendered primarily "LORD," sometimes "GOD," and rarely "Lord."          Now that we understand something about the words "Elohim" and "Jehovah" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is "Jehovah." In trying to prove that "Jehovah" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right. Remember, McConkie said the Father is not "Jehovah;" He is only "Elohim." The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:    "Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit   and he testified, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?" (Ps. 110:1.) Two   Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater   than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this   Messianic prophecy?   "What think ye of Christ?" our Lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry. "Whose son is he?" Is Christ   the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent   or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he   was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the   Jews. And so they answered, "The Son of David."   David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our   Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,   asked, "How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord   said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine   enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his   son?" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the   great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him   as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake   unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is   interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The   Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my   right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)   (emphasis added)          Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6 reads: "The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the Son]..." (brackets in original)          McConkie clearly stated that it is "Elohim" the Father who is speaking to "Jehovah" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at the Hebrew word translated "LORD," it becomes apparent that either the first "LORD" is not the Father or else the Father is "Jehovah." Either way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:    "The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)          The first "LORD" in this verse is "Jehovah" who Mormonism says is Christ, not the Father. The second "Lord" is the Hebrew word "Adon" (singular for "Adonai," meaning master or lord). If the first "LORD" is the Father and the second "Lord" is the Son, then the Father is "Jehovah" and the Son is "Adon." However, if the Father is not "Jehovah" as McConkie claimed, then the first "LORD" is "Jehovah" the Son, but who, then, is "Adon?" Obviously the Father is "Jehovah" in this Psalm, and His Son is "Adon."          Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following:    "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness," _Isaiah quoted the   Father as saying of Christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep   thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the   Gentiles." (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)          McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads:    "I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold   thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the   people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)          According to McConkie, "I the LORD" refers to the Father, and "thine" and "thee" refer to Christ. However, the "LORD" who is speaking is "Jehovah" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is "Jehovah."          Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie stated:    shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord   that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in   him." (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is   found in these words: "The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes   and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be   the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will   believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will   have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which   were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (Matt.   27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)          Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:    "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they   shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would   deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.          McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as Jesus hung on the cross." That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ. Who, then, was the "LORD" in whom he trusted? It was "Jehovah" the Father.          Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them, McConkie stated the following:    "With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "They took counsel   together against me, they devised to take away my life." (Ps. 31:13.)   "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised   Messiah, p. 532)          Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's "arrest and judicial trials." We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter.    "For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while   they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my   life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God   [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)          McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the "LORD" who is called His "God" or "Elohim." Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is "Elohim" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the "Elohim" of the man Jesus is "Jehovah" the Father.          In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses will be considered in this examination.    "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.   But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that   I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)          McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in Christ's death. Since it was Judas who was the "familiar friend" who "lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "I," "my," and "me" in verse 9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "LORD" (Jehovah). Then the pronouns "me" and "I" which refer to Christ are used again. That means Christ was speaking to "Jehovah" the Father in these verses.          Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.         110:4.    "One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,   ever after the order of Melchizedek." (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,   p. 450)          McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ. The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?    "The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest   for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)          Does the "LORD," which is "Jehovah," refer to Christ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is "Jehovah," but the Father is not, then the "LORD" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one addressed as the "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?" The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the "LORD" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.          Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie stated:    "Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...      The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....      It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)      (emphasis added)          McConkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah." However, what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is "Jehovah." Verse 6 reads: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all," and verse 10 reads: "Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise him [Christ]..."          Obviously the "LORD" who laid on Christ "the iniquity of us all" and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called "Jehovah" in these verses.          Remember, McConkie stated that "some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity," and that Christ "came into mortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. He called this concept "misinformation" that is "untrue." To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures:    "In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of   the Seed of David: "I will be his father, and he shall be my son." (2   Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly   Messianic, occurs this statement: "Thou art my Son; this day have I   begotten thee." (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in   Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the   Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)          McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7 refer to Christ who "would come as the Son of God." Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.    "And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people   Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the   LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.   And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,   I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy   bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.   He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2   Sam. 7:11-14)          These verses teach that the "LORD" (Jehovah) would have a Son, the Messiah.         In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination will include verse 8. Notice that it is the "LORD" (Jehovah) who says, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee."    "I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou   art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.   Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.          McConkie said these verses of Scripture are "clearly Messianic," and he acknowledged they teach that "Christ would come as the Son of God." What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is "Jehovah" and that the "sectarians" who believe "Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son" is Jesus Christ, "the Only Begotten," are right in their belief.          Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated the following:    "And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,   this is he of whom it is written_: "He shall stand and feed in the   strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his   God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." (Mic.   5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)          According to McConkie, the pronoun "He" at the beginning of Mic. 5:4 refers to Christ "during his mortal ministry." Who, then, is the "LORD his God?" Mic. 5:4 reads:    "And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD   [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God   [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.          Obviously the "LORD" of Jesus Christ is "Jehovah" the Father who is referred to as "Jehovah his Elohim."          Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses McConkie stated the following:    "A number of Messianic passages speak of "the Lord, and...his   anointed" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated   and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus   applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. "The   Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (Isa.   61:1), and then saying: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your   ears" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)          The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:    "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel   together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.          McConkie said the "anointed" one was Christ. If that is true, who was "Jehovah?" If "Jehovah" is always Christ, who was the "anointed" one? Obviously "Jehovah" is referring to God the Father and the "anointed" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:    "The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the   LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;   he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to   the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;          The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse says the "LORD" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same problem. If "Jehovah" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ, then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, "Jesus applied these passages to himself." Therefore, the "Jehovah" who anointed Christ is God the Father.          Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not "Jehovah." However, these should be enough to expose their error.          Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is "Jehovah," but He is not "Elohim?" It is true that Jesus is "Jehovah." The following Scriptures prove this fact:    "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)   [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and   was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)    "...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have   pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only   son... (Zech. 12:1,10)   Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,   and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)    "...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.   43:3)   ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)    "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of   the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)   "...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name   under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)    "Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his   reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)   ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.   22:12)    "...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with   thee. (Zech. 14:5)   "...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1   Thess. 3:13)    "The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)   [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)    "...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...   (Ezek. 34:15-16)   ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.   (Luke 19:10)    "For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy   Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)   Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and   Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;   Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and   Rev. 3:19)          While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," they are wrong when they say He is not "Elohim." The Bible reveals that "Jehovah" is the only true "Elohim" there is; all others are false. Remember, "Jehovah" is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible.          Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as "Jehovah" and "Elohim" but so is the Holy Spirit.    "Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I   will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my   laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And   their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)   (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" and "said" added)   Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a   new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...   I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;   and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will   forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.   31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)    "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy   men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)   (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" added)   "The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in   my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)          Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.    "And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,   God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,   Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie   acknowledged that "it was" Christ's "voice that spoke to Moses in the   burning bush..." Promised Messiah, p. 394]   And the LORD [Jehovah] said...   And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the   children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your   fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his   name? what shall I say unto them?   And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus   shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto   you.   And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto   the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your   fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and   the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for   ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.   3:4,7,13-15)    "And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD   [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)    "I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God   [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:   (Isa. 45:5)    "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)    "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)    "Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,   saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.   (Amos 5:27)    "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's   [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein   is. (Deut. 10:14)    "Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is   none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,   according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)    "And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],   the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.   (Jon. 1:9)    "For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock   save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)    "Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...   (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)    "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God   [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,   fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his   understanding. (Isa. 40:28)    "The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and   called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down   thereof. (Ps. 50:1)    "Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that   rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.   68:4) [Regarding the word "Jah," Bruce R. McConkie stated: "Jah   (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all   of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel." Mormon   Doctrine, p. 391]    "And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from   Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose   name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that   dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)    "...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is   his name. (Jer. 32:18)    "O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the   wind....   Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD   [Jehovah]....   That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most   high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)          The Bible clearly teaches that "Jehovah" is "Elohim." In fact, He is the only "Elohim" there is. He is the "true," the "living," the "mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting Elohim." He is the "Elohim" of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon. "Jehovah's" name is "Elohim of hosts." (Amos 5:27)          Not only is "Jehovah," "Elohim," but "Elohim" is "Jehovah." The Bible reveals that "Elohim's" name is "Jah" (Ps. 68:4), "Jehovah" (Ps. 83:18), and "Jehovah of hosts." (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation whose "Elohim" is "Jehovah" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not the "Jehovah" and "Elohim" of the Mormons.          Another Mormon error regarding "Elohim" and "Jehovah" is the belief that "Elohim," not "Jehovah," is the Father of all the spirits, including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage, "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve" apostles states that "God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent of...the spirits of the human race." (p. 466) This "Doctrinal Exposition" also states explicitly that "Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of Elohim." (p. 473)          The Apostle Talmage stated that "_Elohim_...is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_--" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter: "...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned." (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)          Mormon leaders claim that "Jehovah-Christ" did not create either man's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon "Elohim," who is the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the truth about who created man.    "And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,   Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all   flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also   16:20-23) (emphasis added)    "...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth   the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within   him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)    "...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)    "For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for   the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have   made_....   ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on "souls...I   have made" added)    "Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...   (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)    "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee   from the womb_.   I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)   (emphasis added)    "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...   I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)   (emphasis added)    "...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...   Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD   [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.   4:32,35)    "Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the   earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the   people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)    "...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of   Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon   the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)          The Bible reveals that it is "Jehovah" who is the "Elohim of the spirits of all flesh" and "of all flesh" itself, that it was He who "formed the spirit of man within him," that He "made us this soul" and "formed us from the womb." He did indeed "create man."          If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are wrong when they say he is not "Jehovah."          Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man, Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:    "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....   And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for   never has man believed in me as thou hast....   Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and   _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)   (emphasis added)    "For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I   that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)    "...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of   Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and   all things that in them are.   Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)          D&C, 93:10 states that "the worlds were made by him [Christ]; _men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him." (emphasis added)          Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving "Jehovah" and his creation is the belief that "Jehovah" had "many" pre-mortal spirits helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.    "That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by "many of   the noble and great" spirit children of the Father is evident from   go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these   materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abra.   3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,   Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other "noble and   great" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines   of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)          The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:    "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee   from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that   stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by   myself. (Isa. 44:24)    "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of   the sea. (Job 9:8)          "Jehovah," by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.          Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim," the Apostle McConkie stated: "Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that "Jesus...is above all save the Father only." (Promised Messiah, p. 363)          The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God "Jehovah."    "For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above   all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)    "For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art   exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)    "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)          If Mormon leaders are right when they say "Jehovah" is god the son and "Elohim" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie clearly stated, Mormons believe "Elohim" the father, not "Jehovah" the son, is the "God above all Gods" -- that Jesus is above all except the father; yet the Bible teaches that "Jehovah" is above all "Elohim."          At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus:    "Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly   to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been   developed....   This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the   Father, and to him only....   ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;   it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With   the Lord, pp. 19-20)          McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons "pray to the Father, not the Son..." On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that "Christ [the Son] is Jehovah." This is important to remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is "Jehovah," the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to "Jehovah," and He not only heard those prayers, but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to "Jehovah."    "In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my   God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came   before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)    "And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy   supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this   house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)    "And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our   supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD   [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)    "O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to   the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who   desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)    "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this   prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before   the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his   hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)    "He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed   unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)    "Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God   [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy   tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)    "I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I   said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and   thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.   For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when   thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)          Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the "godly" pray to "Jehovah." According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray.          The Bible reveals there is only one true "Elohim," and His name is "Jehovah." All other "Elohim" are false. They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true "Elohim" and idolatry.    "For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to   be feared above all gods [Elohim].   For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD   [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)    "Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)    "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)    "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God   [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and   worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish. (Deut. 8:19)    "Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].   They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:   for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto   thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)    "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn   aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)    "That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;   neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to   swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.   (Josh. 23:7)    "...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)    "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)    "And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,   which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods   [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about   them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]   to anger. (Jud. 2:12)    "Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods   [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I   will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know   that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)    "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you   this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your   fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods   [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my   house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].   And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should   forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.   24:15-16)          These verses teach that the only true, living "Elohim" in heaven and on earth is "Jehovah" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein.          "Jehovah" is greater than any "Elohim," because all other "Elohim" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17) "Jehovah Elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false "Elohim." He told His people not to have any "Elohim" but Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false "Elohim," those "Elohim" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. He warned the people to "take heed" that their "heart be not deceived" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making covenants with false "Elohim." "Jehovah Elohim" told His people He would eventually judge all false "Elohim" and their followers.          Despite these warnings and guidelines, "Elohim's" covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false "Elohim's" of the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that "the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods [Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim] of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him."          This examination has shown that the "Elohim" of Mormonism, like the "Elohim" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true "Jehovah Elohim." Therefore, the people who leave the true "Elohim" for the Mormon "Elohim" will do "evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah]."          Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father [Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is triune; He is Spirit; He is "Jehovah;" and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind.          It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who "thrash around in...darkness" about who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. One wonders what "Holy Writ" McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that "Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son." He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one "Jehovah Elohim." He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as "Jehovah."  Summary          Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons "have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God" (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry.          In answer to Jesus' question, "But whom say ye that I am," Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in "another Jesus" whom Paul warned about.          Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that "it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." (p. 26)          The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore, they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: "Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God." (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also rightly stated that "the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God," because the "true names of Deity" can be applied to "false concepts of God." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave "a new conception of God and the Godhead." (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p. 1)          It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.    "...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from   me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD   [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)    "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God   [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and   worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish. (Deut. 8:19)    "Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)    "...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be   clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)    "...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)          It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible. If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry. Remember, to know the "only true God" is eternal life. (John 17:3)
 Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most fundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that a Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by Palestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the Palestinian people.
 I don't think touting contributions is a good idea.  World War II produced many many beneficial spinoffs.  Eg. Radar, jet aeroplanes, rocket technology. I don't think anyone would argue that World War II was, in and of itself, a good thing.  If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in and of itself.
  Yeah!  That's it! :)  You've really outdone yourself this time Nick... Don't forget the "Davidian Muslims"... :)  Islam is not a race.  It's a religion.  You can be white, black, Fijian or Alaskan.  I guess you didn't absorb too much of the Malcolm X interest circulating.  You see, the whole point of Islam is that it stresses equality amongst all peoples.  Now, I do realize this is difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian ethnic cleansing, but give it a try, it's really not that difficult.   That's right, it's a Disneyland war -- all a setup for the TV cameras. There are also people who believe man never landed on the moon, that the whole Apollo story was done in TV studios...   Terms of secession?  You are, of course, joking, right Nick?  Nobody *chose* to fight.  Bosnia and Croatia were *internationally* recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their well-documented genocide.  That makes them an outside aggressor.  It's a simple genocide, a classical example of ethnic cleansing.  There is no question of civil war...
 Here you give positive, accurate "facts" about what happened to the beduins and the land:     After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev    Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The    10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of    40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150    mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out    of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,    spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin    shepherds from roaming.     A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.    But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these    Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure    was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields    in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:     No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held    today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of    the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized    by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now    confined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established    for them.     (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:    elias@ismennt.is)  So what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happens there now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there."  Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?  BTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full brigade of them.
    Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16). In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human than any of the rest of us.     You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Mary's preservation from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ He not" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore, Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and were necessary even for Mary's salvation.
  Attention please!  According to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates to the point where Hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared ended.  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  Clearly further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the current name calling and invocation of Hitler's name is not productive even by the standards of usenet talk groups.  If you must continue, please don't discuss this in misc.legal.  It's not about the law.  If you would like to discuss the law as it applies to the Waco incident, please ask questions of the form: "if the FBI started the fire accidentally, who would be legally responsible for the deaths".  Note that followups are set not to include misc.legal.
Josip,  please, don't be offended at this question: Who are the "Muslims" in the Bosnian context? i know that a moslem/muslim is a believer in Islam. Islam  is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. But it is not , yes definitely not, an ethinic group. ok! so, these Bosnian Muslims, who are they? to which ethnic group do they belong? what language(s) do they speak? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats?  the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has  kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was  changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!
OFM Comments:   No disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on. But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite different from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the usual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he does. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of  Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good  reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal  hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between  God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built on Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were removed, there would BE no foundation.    That's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians  that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God. I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if my response to God is motivated on fear.    Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com)  --
   First, I don't expect them to love me if they don't even know I   exist.  Secondly, I wouldn't expect them to love me simply because   they were my creator.  I would expect to have to earn that love.     Are you daft?  How do I love something I don't believe exists?   Come back when you've learned to love your third testicle.     At which point you have stepped over the line and become a   complete asshole.  Even though it's your first offense, I won't   let it slip becuase I've heard it too goddamned many times.    You love Jesus because deep in your heart you're a cannibalistic   necrophiliac.  Because I say so, and I'm much more qualified to   assess your motivations than you are.    Fortunately, there are some things I get to accept on evidence   rather than faith.  One of them being that until christians like   yourself quit being so fucking arrogant, there will never be   peace.  You've all made sure of that.  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.
 1) Well, Mr Koresh allowed other children and adults to leave the compound during the course of the siege; why didnt these children leave then? I dont know myself, and certainly havent heard any answers on this here.  2) Yes, one simple non-action, ie NOT attacking the compound with modified tanks, would have prevented this tragedy. I bet you blamed the MOVE people for the deaths that occurred in adjacent row houses in Philadelphia, not the government which dropped the firebomb, right?
 My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books (which after his death his "brothers" came over and took from his greiving widow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British Masonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide ("mystery").  Special handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to "evangelize" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a "mystery" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of. I haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same conclusion.    "Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man.  He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of Fortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......."  Hislop  It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)  Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted cow".  I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?
  The remainder of my article deleted stated why. One would be an egotist to believe that someone CARED about what Bill R. thought he needed to say about God. Whether they did or not is irrelevant.
    When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,    the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a    likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,    it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the    Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to    believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the    authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved    private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I    suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but    if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not    orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an offense, but not a heretic.  Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.  "Approval" of an apparition by the Church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.  I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.  Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into someone without a heart.

MILLER, JR  "A Canticle for Leibowitz" One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with ink and leaving white lines and letters.  EDGAR PANGBORN  "Davy" Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example, forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms".   PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  "Galactic Pot-Healer" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  "A Maze of Death" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  "VALIS" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  "The Divine Invasion" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  "The Handmaid's Tale" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it "right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  "The Bible" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.                               Books -- Non-fiction  PETER DE ROSA  "Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988 Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc. (German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums", Droemer-Knaur, 1989)  MICHAEL MARTIN  "Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press,  Philadelphia, USA. A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the existence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the non-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne. 541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)  "The Case Against Christianity", Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately) demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent. 273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5  JAMES TURNER  "Without God, Without Creed", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,  MD, USA Subtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America".  Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists."  316 pages.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's "What Great Men Think of Religion" and Noyes' "Views of Religion". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  "The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  "The Miracle of Theism", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for God" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

 Of course not. There's more than a little difference between formulating foreign policy and overseeing the ATF's handling of a scenario involving a group of religious fanatics. Why do people compare apples and oranges?
pdb059@ipl.jpl.nasa.gov (Paul Bartholomew) writes to Clayton Cramer:   The saddest thing is that most people, like Cramer's wife, learn dislike for homosexuality early in childhood.
   On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.    To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:    1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and    anachronisms.    2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices    which are at variance with sacred Scripture.    3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of    subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.    4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine    Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and    poetic and religious feeling.  First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.  Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the canonical books (i.e. Daniel).  Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in nature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons.  These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity.
         When I say "black," I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one  team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better with the local audience than blacks did.     Don't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history  includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority;  the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been the object of national obsession.   Absolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing. But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is  not without some small reason.   Well, there's the list.  Go for it!  I'll cull some more names as I go. I expect you're right, btw.
But wouldn't that go for any sin.  My father told me when he was growing up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced. There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible" with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges, etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have given in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust  Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?  Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and the Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees, hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins, those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of.  The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers,  those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.
Editorial - A10, Saturday, April 24, 1993      CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN      With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists     that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the     same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-     moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's     new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-     ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.      CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily     crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,     including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is     applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and     staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is     primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the     rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.      Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.      The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun     control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek     reasonable regulation of firearms.      But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear     need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-     countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.      When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-     Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars     to getting criminals off the street.
 Riddle me this.  If a god(s) exist why on earth should we grovel?  Why on earth should we give a damm at all?  What evidence do you have that if such a creature(s) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer hatred for what it/they have done in the past (whichever god(s) you care to pick).  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct.  Religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate from the physical world.  Any belief system can leave you in such a state and so can drugs.  God(s) are not a requirement.  Only if you remove such useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon. It is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe (or converting them).   - Eric  NEW VIRUSES:
   Why shouldn't I mind? It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. I always preceeded my statements with "it is my understanding that..." Now, I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and  with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.   I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  other such opaque "concepts" often used by people to camoflage the  baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology. These are just the sorts of "concepts" used by Christian churches the perverting of their religion.    Alaikum Wassalam,
whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) sent in a list of verses  which he felt condemn homosexuality.  mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) wrote in  response that some of these verses "are used against us only through incredibly  perverse interpretations" and that others "simply do not address the issues."  [remainder of my post deleted]  The moderator then made some comments I would  like to address:   If you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse. Therefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in this way.   Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to "save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?  - Mark
 Sadly understandable...   Yes.  To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.   Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of "personal interpretation".   This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of "testing hypotheses" against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.   Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant, unfortunately.   Granted   In which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun, merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I may be so bold as to extend your similie?   Also understandable... ;)  --   best regards,
...  That people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might be considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound.   When EVERYONE dies (save for nine people), including twenty children, the  outcome must be considered a failure.  Now was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances, incompetence, or negligence?  From the double talk and multiple stories I've seen on the news coming from the FBI and Reno I find "it was an honest mistake" hard to swallow  Let's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions.
 It came from a reseller survey.    I don't recall any FUD here.  Maybe an example?    For the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented.  Microsoft has been attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as well.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might feel is unwarranted is leveled.
 Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on everything.  Sure.  If you can't provide an answer, change the assumptions to something you can deal with.  It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's a matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in. Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a mall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, and acquires your name.  It's a matter of any number of possible wiretap abuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip can sabotage.   Par for the course, though.  I predicted that you'd be jumping in in favor of this.  The reply was that you'd justify anything up to and including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a written policy statement.  Perhaps a little extreme, but not much.
   I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more conservative-literalist approach to the Bible, as distinct from "liberals".   I would use the word "Christian" (unqualified) to describe someone to whom the above definition applied.  BTW, it applies to me.  [deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs and/or practices.]  I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided, I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any *legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).  [Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll (provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support the allegations?]  Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several women in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a civil liberties perspective.    I think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at Ray Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but at Stephen Tice.
This discussion on "objective" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is "subjective" and that even atom are "subjective." This is getting a bit silly and the word "objective" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the definition of "objective" which has been already presented:    objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as      distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.     3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on     observable phenomenon.  The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective.  Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though that observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively "good;" I will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective.   Now some examples things which are "objective":  A D-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks  ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.  "Good" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined "good").  We cannot quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag full of "good").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" an objective meaning, e.g.  "good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see "strength" and etc, as necessarily "good" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism  is not generally viewed as "good").   As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of the "Golden Rule," which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a manner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face," they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can at times, ignore that form of the "Golden Rule" without fear of reprisal.  Now as to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quite subjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical existence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such morality.   One other thing to notice, "objective" is many times used as synonymous with "true" and/or "absolute," and "subjective" sometimes has the connotation of "false" and/or "relative." Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be both objective and false.  As to "absolute," it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either "absolutist," or "true." For instance, there are some theists who are specifically "absolutist" in their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a "gut feeling" or "hunch"), to investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence.   				Later,  				Dave Butler
[material deleted]  [deletions]   I don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it, since I see no  Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy.   But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices "parallel"  Mormon temple ceremonies.  Could you give an example?  Also, why do they only  parallel Mormon ceremonies?  Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original  Christian practices?  Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated  mission?
 This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John (remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about Elijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.  A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.  Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.    Rick.  ________________________________________________________________  Richard Johnston                             Queen`s University 73 Malone Road                               Belfast Belfast                                  Northern Ireland                           BT9 6SB
  Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace  hears "prophesies" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship (or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter. That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here.  --- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----  Both read the same Bible, and pray  to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem  strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing  their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American  Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe  to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty  scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue,  until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of  unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with  the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three  thousand  years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord,  are true and righteous altogether"   With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right,  as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we  are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have  borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which  may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves,  and with all nations.   --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---
 No, Dave, and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this  misrepresentation.  I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation (science) to religion (see above).  I have characterized science/*creation  science* as rationalism/nonsense, and that it is.  When people promote their  religious beliefs as science they become nonsense.  Kept where they belong  they are meaningful and useful, as virtually any anthropologists will tell you, and as I have said several times in this group.  And it works the other way,  too, and I have repeatedly said so.  Never have I said or meant anything  different, here or elsewhere, and I don't think my communication skills betray me.  Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities, as I would hope others would not disparage mine.
 Er, people are going to make personal attacks on Prof. Denning whether she posts here or not.  That much should be obvious from looking at the traffic over the last few weeks.  Therefore I conclude that the existence of personal attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post.  I suspect that Prof. Denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for not posting, and that the real reason for the silence is that Clipper is not the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via reasoned argument.   mathew
 However, he said on his radio show today that he won't read anything from the two alt groups. He simply deletes them without reading them. He says that some of the people in the two groups are vicious.
 "Society" is impossible without some shared set of moralities, sense of what is "god" and what is "bad" action and basic foundation of  something "universal".
 STOP IT!!!! ENOUGH!!! I'm out of there!  I mean, I'm a relatively sane person.  God knows I'm weak and will forgive me.  But I'm not stupid enough to stay in this place any longer.  I WANT OUT!!!   Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me. Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs, is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never know...
  I guess you need to be reminded of some things!  Have you ever heard of the First Amendment?  I guess not.  It isn't a crime to be a religous (I know you said "sacraligious", but it isn't your place to judge his religion) zealot in this country.  REMEMBER we have freedom of religion in this country! I guess you are selective in that respect!  So what if they were "bastard" children.  They were CHILDREN!  Do you condone their deaths?  I pray for your lack of a soul if you do!
 [SB] Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day [SB] of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait, you [SB] chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact  [SB] OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's [SB] because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was [SB] Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs [SB] who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET [SB] BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli [SB] shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response [SB] to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan 							     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [SB] Heights. Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel ^^^^^^^^^^^^ [SB] finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  [SB] the borders could be expanded.  I agree with all you write except that Terrorist orgs. were not shelling Israel from the Golan Heights in 1982, but rather from Lebanon. The Golan Heights have been held by Israel since 1967, and therefore the PLO could not have been shelling Israel from there, unless there is something I am not aware of.   Tsiel

I do get your distinction between motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows' atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.

If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad too say "religion did this".  I'm saying that the causes are far more complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the  killing', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not to read minds. # # #|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions, #|> and the many religous wars. # #What's so special about these exceptions?

Woo! So far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of the `Whore of Babylon' in Rev 17 & 18:  a) The United States of America b) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who    corrupt and oppress human society c) Historical Jerusalem d) Historical Rome  Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How about * The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City's special call, it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time (Rev 11:8? - also isn't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and is equally subject to God's judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created. (b)  Clever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all!   I think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God's grace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.'
  Brian, have you checked out what your priests told you in the Bible to see whether they were telling you the truth?  Did you know that according to the Bible, there shouldn't even be such things as "priests" anymore?  Do you know why the preisthood was established in the Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus, there were no priests--that is until the Roman Catholic Church  300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring the whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews?  You said you analyzed the Bible very closely.  I think you are lying.  For if you had, I would think you would have at least got the doctrine of hell straight.
: Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result : of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show : others of one's rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our : sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the  : judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged  : ourselves.    I'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's superior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs.  I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive me.  Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's religion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied beliefs.  It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong. Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs correct.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior.  It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than my God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?  Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation of one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.  Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in our lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another, "I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm in the ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I really cannot help it."  Were this person truely humble, he would take a different approach.  "God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know that you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me, I have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord, please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Please help me to change."  :  : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically : don't have anything to do with them.  For me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company.  When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like being confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me. At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my ways.  The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not. It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation in our lives instead.  : But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance, : many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if : we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that : reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions. :   Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil's aim is to get us into as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting those that the Father loves so much.   -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

    You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews... So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the bosnian muslims were "Turks". After all, there aren't many "real"  (ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of one's culture.   Can you support this?
 +>Critisism is too easy. What solutions do people have that  would have been +>better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months?   After the seige began:  Surround the place with Razor wire and then let them sit.  Do not have daily press conferences, do your best to keep things out of the press.   As things get more and more miserable inside, one of two things is going to happen:  	1. People will start coming out.  	2. They will commit suicide in mass at some point.   The thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and "assults" play into the hands of a "leader" who has picked this course.   Its much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there is gas coming in and bullets in the air.  Let them be hungry and miserable for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective.  	The "possiblity" that they would all kill themselves at some point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics.  If people are going to take their own lives, the best you can probably do is prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to do it.
I appeal to to all of you to show up in Washington DC. this saturday to participate in a peaceful demonstration for the sake of humanity!! This is a  critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things will not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing will go on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fall of thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happened to the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next victim??  Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US to take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and this is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained public pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that  he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and  join the band-wagon later if it ever moves!   Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual will make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a great cause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts who are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option  for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...

Does anyone belong to or know any facts about the               Christian Reformed Church?
 Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new to our species...  What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The religious persecutions of the middle-ages?   What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans? The Jews persecuted by Christians?  There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a thousand years ago!  There is nothing new about violence.
      Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?  OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal abuse just to name three.  So, God's definition of fair and ours differ.  Some points of perspective:  Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take God's word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..."  More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (Rom 7,8)  "...God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes." -Eccl  Mark
 	  The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free    will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows    everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and    are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows    everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God    is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination    against free will.  We believe in both.  That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember.  There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be completely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, it would be good evidence that the religion was man-made.  In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God's will over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate. Catholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come up with a pat reconciliation...
   Don't be so vague. Let us reexamine it - shall we?      Here you descend into total inanity. Your inability to distinguish between 'the cold-blooded genocide of Muslim people by the Armenians'  and 'the Armenian war' is incredible. Now, please provide us with your  corrections.

Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975)." (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  "In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days."  "Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves."  "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies."  "...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final  plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the   president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:   'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the    glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian   arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the   Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining   under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey   who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new   free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]  Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. Preparations were made to strike the Ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to St. Petersburg confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul."

"An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection, and it   appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be  able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian  civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from  the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted  Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from  Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new   Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250,000 Armenians  crowded into the Van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed  no more than 50,000 people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163]"  [162] Hovannisian, "Road to Independence," p. 56; FOP 2488, nos. 127223 and 58350.

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The  entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars)  constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia  was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please  look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, "Armenia on the Road to  Independence.") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime  by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They  are: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard R. Hartill; "Adventures in the Near  East" by A. Rawlinson; "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn.  Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings  of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about  this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin  interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia,  Sir Oliver Wardrop.   "An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the  systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of   the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at   least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The   memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and   eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in  1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.'

qpalo@digi.lonestar.org (Gerry Palo)   For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and misleading innuendos as part of their exposes.  A recent book on cults I picked up by a "Christian" author quite simply mixed in all non-Christian religions (except the Jews) and various New Age groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.   Given the record of American Christianity, any group that falls into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically into the Inquisition business.  It is an unavoidable affliction of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth (tm). And let's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod Lutherans, and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers.  I am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly Christian indoctrination into public schools than I am about yoga classes there.

  Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in his later writings.  And as I have already pointed out, in a previous letter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the deuterocanon from the beginning.  And the Protestants in the 1500's all of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council, and Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired.  Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^
Sorry about the delay in responding, due to conference paper deadline panic.   [Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]   That ("complicated") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more the other way around. It's from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more "complicated" than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.   Well, "P(x | A) = P(x | B)" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are "equally consistent with the data" in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know the actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.   That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.  Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission, G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.   Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations,  which I loosely termed "appearances of god/s", have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism expends on making "appearances of god/s" possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an "appearance of god/s" must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is "the coin is fair", and that B is "the coin is unfair (two-headed)". (I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they don't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between "unfair coin" and atheism, and between "fair coin" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which would falsify "unfair coin", is analogous to an "appearance of god/s", which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle is the same.    Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call "the G in the HG", in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.   The hypotheses don't have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model', the theism isn't falsifiable.    You don't have to. We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha, and all else is equal.   Any observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which would count as "appearances of god/s". Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of revelation.    OK, we'll downgrade "*does* interact" to "*may* interact", which would actually be better since "does interact" implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.   I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction "Appearances of god/s will never happen", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as "Prayer is efficacious" (implying "If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious"), or "Prayer is *not* efficacious", or "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled." I don't think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.    That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.     I think you are; an "appearance of god/s" is sufficient to falsify atheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.   No: by way of a counterexample, let X = "the coin is fair", or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) "the two sides of the coin are different". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable, and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.     Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.   We agree here.   "The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992." Said Rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure to happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it.  "No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed." That about sums the whole thing up.   Cheers  Simon
: Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity? : Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex : completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, : to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, : etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time. : (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders : to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)  The difference is that straight members are given the choice of abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only to some.  Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they _must_ be celibate.  I don't believe that God gives me a forced choice between having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality (within the context of a faithful relationship).  Nor do I believe that God gives that forced choice to gays.  Sex or Christianity is a false dichotomy.  : To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII : starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is : this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are : Christian.  For my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at best, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.
 [a lot of stuff deleted -- i'm focusing on just one point]  i'm a little confused about the difference between this "weak atheism", as you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not necessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those.  ???  actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not ever decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the atheists, of course -- i'd assume that's why they're here!).  i guess some people don't really consider it important to think about the answers to "life, the universe and everything" -- any comment?  just wondering....   tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it didn't work too well!  especially tough as i'm still mulling over whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my chaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of luck, and please do post what you find.   hmm, how so?  i guess i really don't understand.  there are times, of course, when i say to myself "of course i have absolutely no way of knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be psychological".  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you mean?  the only "proof" i have is that i believe God spoke to me once -- which could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is, though, that if you don't at some point start believing in something, after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it's just a question of where you draw the line.   i'll only add one question -- have you read pascal?  what did you think of him if you did?  also you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis/ _surprised by joy_.  i'd be interested in knowing what you think of him, no sarcasm at all intended.  (i just say this because one can never know how one's written words will be interpreted.  i am not interested in converting you, since i don't seem to have whatever it would take -- proof -- to do so.  i'm just interested in learning.)   i like this.
 It seems to me that the original question was for advice on his problem not a history lesson - I think that  if this question comes up from time to time then people should get a civil answer      Could ANYONE please explain WHAT happens with a battery and is there any cure to get it back into life
    It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim . In Bosnia , it is more or less used as an ethnic term not as religious one . There are people in Bosnia who refer to themselves as "Christian Bosnian Muslims" if you can make sense of that . Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language.  Bosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam. I got this from Bosnian Muslim friend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin.
 Mr. Cramer, when are you going to stop indulging in such blatant lies? This is not only not true, you know damned well that it's not true.  None of your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this position.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any research or any knowledge.  According to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of homosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%. Source:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry, the title escapes me).  Conclusions that can be drawn from this:  none.   Oh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are you planning on celebrating two years of lies?  Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans, women, and other minorities who also want to "impose their morality on others".  After all, they also want the government to "tell peaceful people how to live."  Therefore, you really "have no choice", but to continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not a lifestyle, but a sickness.  It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade and it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.
 NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of hostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make it sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the first place. I have some interesting news for youBATF has absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases.   It seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage.  Then the FBI showed up, negotiated to have a few of the hostages  released, but were unable to keep the BATF from killing the rest  of the poor people trapped inside the compound.

 This is where Freeman's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous.  [his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in Illinois] I did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received about my "Semantics on t.p.g" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business.     Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times.
  And you know what?  There is no such method inherent in real life either.  So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we  cannot state, with any level of objectivity, that Mother Theresa has accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin. After all, life on earth is a team effort.   Have you tried glasses?  I find them quite useful.    After all, there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present.  It's too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge; you live a poorer life as a result of that choice.  Heck, I'd wager that you could predict a WS winner with greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  And you know why?  Because I have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary, you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level.      Have you tried calling a kettle black?   In other words, in your world, you cannot objectively state that Jack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last year.  In your world, that may indeed be true.  Fortunately, in the world the rest of us occupy, it's not.  I hope you never serve on a jury, Roger.  I think the rest of the jury would have to kill you.  "There's no way I can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty.  You see, there are 2 billion other people on this planet.  We have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't for all the other people on the planet.  We have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet, because living on this planet is a team effort.  And no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society; he is a part of that society.  That being case, anything I have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity, so I refuse to vote."
      These zealots. Holy fuck.       Israel. Armenia. Turkey. Greece. Croatia. Serbia. Bosnia. Russia. Germany. Iran. The Arab World.       War.
  What?  Absolutely not.  No way.  Asimov was a lifelong atheist, and said so many times, right until his death.  Judging from the many stories he told about his own life, he felt culturally closest to Judaism, which makes sense. He was born Jewish.
It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it. If people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.  The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice.  I agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the things Jesus warned us about.
[does he believe in predestination]  really?  you may be right, but i'd like proof.  as far as i know (and i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination.  my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions!  i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute.   right.  that doesn't really seem like predestination to me, but i'll continue with what you're saying....   this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for ALL of us.  preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses.  but then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i? others?   so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved, and nothing in between.  hmmmm.   although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to be some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell.  in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth.  that's almost like the converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....    so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's  sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?   [my stuff deleted]  >We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but  >does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the  >U.S. or even the U.N. involved?

  Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin?  Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the  hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of  innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia.  They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman  Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide  as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.  Source: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol          to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.  "I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in   the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly   defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder  the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."

     Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test  new features around.  Now at this time PGP (and certainly the newer version) was unknown over here.  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received a request that I stop sending encrypted email.  Now there is almost no way that some automatic scanner could have found this, since they wouldn't have known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the message, tried to unscramble it, found they couldn't get past the PEM armour part, and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop.  Luckily the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their networks :-).  In case people think email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure you that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government agencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who, for reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications (I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/ terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).  There have been several occasions when I've got people into trouble simply by including the traditional NSA bait in a message (I don't try it any more now :-).  A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of the UK town of Scunthorpe (hint: look for words embedded in it).  I'm sure there are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any examples I'd appreciate hearing from them - I could use them as ammunition during talks on privacy issues).  Peter.
Good points.  In addition, I would point out that now is one of the best times to fight this political battle, with much of the opposition in disarray -- an FBI director (Sessions) on his way out, an Attorney General (Reno) who has only been in long enough to find the office coffee machine two tries out of three (and, between slow confirmations and Clinton's Saturday Night Massacre, hasn't much of a staff in place). If we really get lucky, both of the above will be too busy trying to keep their feet from being held to the Waco fire to spend much effort insisting on their alleged right to spy on the American people.

Igor and I had thought that if it was  a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy,  we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.  Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew  up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16.  In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in  Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son, Seryozha, is four and a half.  First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from  work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were  Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were  both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were  shouting, "There's no room for Christians here!" and "When we finish with the  Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!" And some even cried Out, "Death to  the Armenians!" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became  frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen  downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich  Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he  returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was  smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I  was telling him everything, too, and he said, "What, is there no longer any government?" That same day Igor said, "Papa, something terrible is happening  in the city." And he said, "We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our  own home."  The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called  our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the  same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an  Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I  called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and  nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.  On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were  afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I  told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't  be coming in. He agreed, and even said, "Fine, don't come in, we understand  what's going on in town, don't come in."  Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my  father-in-law and said, "Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are  happening in town." Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, "With my own eyes I  saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know," he said, "we  should leave town." Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we  should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together,  clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the  building manager came by and said, "Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is  bad, don't go out." My father even opened up to him and said, "Maybe we'll  drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there." "No," he said, "it'll be worse  there, you'll be safer at home." He said don't be afraid, if something happens  I'll send people to save you.  After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our  courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two  children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my  mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of  them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, "Go in that room and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home." The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my  brother-in-law's wife, suggested, "Let's run out onto the balcony." We -- the two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said,  "Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all." We lived on the second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I  pleaded and begged: "Please, call someone, have someone come!" I even started  shouting. "I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them  and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive." Either they  were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were  watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it  again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the  building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A  bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children  over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet  seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first;  you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think,  and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and  crying. My Kristina said, "Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're  afraid!" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina  didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, "I'm staying with Grandmother, I'm staying with Grandma!" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And  my mother-in-law shouted, "Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there,  save Kristina, too!" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira  helped us and went back inside.  We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist,  Sevil, open the door, open it, please!" She didn't open it. "No, go away, go  anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door." She was our neighbor, we were  friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we  were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and  said, "Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll  kill us, too, because of you." I begged, "Please, at least take the children,  we'll leave, we'll go back." "No," she said, "you have to leave." Her sons ran  in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: "Get out  of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!" I became terrified, I took the  children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down  and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard "The Armenians must be  killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!" One of  them said, "Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!" When I  heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their  door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any  longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay,  that they would save her.  My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next  entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a  half. They were crying, "Mamma, we're scared!" They were so frightened that I  didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was  awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, "Open up, let  me inside!" He opened the door slightly and said, "No!" "No" and that was it!  He said it so sternly: "No!" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists  on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood  there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get  down on my knees. "Please, I beg of you, at least take the children." He  wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me  inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't  passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want  to open the door. And again I started pleading, "Please, open the door, it's  our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!" And he said, "No, I'm afraid." I said again  and again, "Please, open the door, please!" He looked at me. He looked at me  for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We  threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into  the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, "Calm  the children, and calm yourselves down, too."  Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in  our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I  said, "Igor, Edik, let's say farewell." And Edik turned around and looked at  me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would  kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They  started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that  he had told us, "Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight." He thought we  were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them:  "Edik, Igor, let's say farewell." Igor didn't think we could climb over to the  other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were  able to save ourselves.  Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All  the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next  to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from  the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: "Open the door!" We  were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, "They're home, they're in there, break down the door!" And I remember my father-in-law  whispering, "They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . "  He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were  going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal  chair legs. From outside the door they said, "We're counting to five, open  up!" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was  home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law  had said, "It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be?  Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with  everyone." And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani  guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there  often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save  ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, "I'm not  leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight  alongside them." That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said,  "If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight  alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere."  We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and  shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor  at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's  voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a  long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: "Open the  door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's  her voice!" But the Lezgin said, "It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in  your apartment." He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and  the Lezgin opened the door and said, "Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran  away." He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him  outside, next to the building.  While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The  way Ira shouted! She shouted, "Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!"  She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many  people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling,  whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.  Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway  where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I  don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed  over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law  were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming  up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were  our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them.  They were sleeping. I woke them up: "Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!" And I tell  Ira: "Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony." We  were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door  too, because later he said, "I opened the door and told them there were no  Armenians inside." And after they all left our neighbor went out on the  balcony himself to see: they were gone.  We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from  the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider  hiding us.  The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said,  "Karina, there're no lights on in our block." The whole block was dark, the  whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, "I'm afraid to keep you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving you." I said, "What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere else to hide." He said, "Well OK, go look." I asked Ira, "Ira, do you want to go?" Ira said, "No, I'll stay with the children, Karina." I said, "Fine, then I'll go." Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one  was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at  after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never  went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the  boarding school and my director answered. He said, "Karina, where are you?" I didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I  was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what  time it was, I asked him, "What time is it?" He said 11:20, I think, but I  don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I  look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse  for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen  grabbed my hand and squeezed it: "Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on,  what are you turning around for?" I turned around and saw a large truck, it  must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck  like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the  fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police  then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the  police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, "Soldier, in  Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to  save them!" And he said, "Go to the police station and tell them everything."  I said, "I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them." He said, "Don't be  afraid."  We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military  vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the  police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that  they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to them.  After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us  to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they  took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there,  very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was  only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots,  nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.  The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably  alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of  Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came  and told us, "Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party  Committee." My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for  six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee  and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira  had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went  by. And then one of the functionaries told us, "Karina, Ira, gather your  courage. Would you like to go to the burial?" I said, "What, did they really  kill all of them?!" He said, "Let's look." He had a long list, and he started  reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in- law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law, and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said,  "Get in the car, let's go to the burial."  We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my  children when they're older?  My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, "My grandma is  better than anyone!" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's  difficult for her, and once she told her: "You're a bad grandmother."  I don't know why, I asked her, "Kristina, where's Papa?" and she said, "They  killed him." She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, "When Papa  comes I'm going to tell him everything!"

  Lucky they brought the situation to a prompt resolution before they had to  turn things over to the amateurs.   God help us all. --
It seems that, to keep the peace talks going, Israel has to keep making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while Palestinian Arabs continue to go around hunting Jews.  If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success, the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially since they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return for giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the already agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favorite games, the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth the parchment they're written on.  It takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to start doing their share.
 From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an introduction to the article "Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of 	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as 	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church's 	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one 	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world 	countries. 	 	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and 	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict 	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly 	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of 	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief 	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion, 	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in 	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it 	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. 	 	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy 	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western 	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft 	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, 	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed 	government officials. 	 	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by 	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had 	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill 	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he 	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of 	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written "by 	the commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrews 	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors 	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who 	have been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited 	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can 	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the 	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been 	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and 	as heretics by religious fundamentalists. 	 	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was 	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because 	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from 	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, 	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham 	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over 	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further 	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of 	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice 	in nineteenth-century America. 	 	While other religions go back many centuries -- 	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, 	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are 	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon 	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this 	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny 	is dangerous to the faith. 	 	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles 	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong 	member of the church, provides a detailed critical 	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of 	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion 	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a 	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the 	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz 	  The article itself is super.
  You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women sinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is transmitted from generation to generation.  Andy Byler]
Edgar Pearlstein asks (Fri 7 May 1993) whether the Supreme Court, or any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of religion.  The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined "R T & B" as "an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code."  In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER, the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit     We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme    Being" rather than the designation "God," .... the test of belief    "in a relation to a Superme Being" is whether a given belief that    is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its    possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God    of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such    beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective    holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a Supreme    Being" and the other is not...."  My immediate reference is THE FIRST FREEDOM, by Nat Hentoff, (Delacorte 1980, Dell 1981).
  Poor 'Poly'. I see you're preparing the groundwork for yet another  retreat from your 'Arromdian-ASALA/SDPA/ARF' claims.    Just love it. If that does ever happen, look out the window and see if there is a non-fascist/Nazi x-Soviet Armenian Government in the East.  By the way, your ignorance on the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim  people is hardly characteristic of most 'Arromdians'.    Source: K. S.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,  the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic  genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of  annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering  2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year  homeland.  The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

   There is one point I'd like to make, that most people seem to have forgotten. That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST of governmental authority and control. All those "checks & balances" is because they realize that you should distrust those in power. What everyone seems to have forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the right to bear arms. It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself against other citizens, but to prevent the government from taking away your only means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. Its hard to oppress your citizenry when its armed against you.  I am not a fanatic, I'm a retired Naval officer. Because I have spent so much time defending it, perhaps I understand its "purpose" as well as its "plan".
:  : It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal : setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose : that never seems to occur?...   Advances in freedom have been made in the past.  The "divine right of king" concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same argument, that it hadn't come about before.  But our ancestors had the courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many was necessary to have a decent, wholesome society.  In the 1800s the  concept of slavery was questioned.  Our ancestors had the courage to question a practice that had existed for thousands of years.  Was the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent,  wholesome society?  Now libertarians question the necessity of majoritarianism.  Is it necessary that many people rule over many others to have a decent, wholesome society?
Found this in soc.culture.pakistan Might be of interest..... am posting it without the permission of the original poster. Hope he/she doesnt mind.   By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.   Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district running.   Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of  Jews living in Sarajevo.   ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping  people alive,'' Ceresnjes said.   As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and  had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.   They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia- Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.   The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.   While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to centuries of Turkish occupation.   Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were hidden by Muslim families in Mostar.    --  Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham, MA  USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com   ---------------------------------------- Zafar.

Weird, eh?
 In Massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but if you convince the cops/DA that you used lethal force because of threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges would probably be dropped.  If you run away and are later caught, then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury of your innocence.  Going "on the lam" is seen as an indication of guilt by a lot of people.
 That probably is not true.  But today it may not be much better for the gay population in general.   Where are all of these studies?  You have cited a few, and my research shows that there are not that many.  Do Not Confuse a survey as a study, there is a big difference.  Asking people outside of a polling booth and adding up numbers is NOT a study.   But this is what you base most of your conclusion upon. Warm fuzzy feelings.  Maybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies that involve genetics and psychological influence.  There are a lot of those types of studies, aren't there?  Try reading some.  This is a crap statement and comparison.  Many people use this sad and stupid argument.  There is not relationship between alcoholics and people's sexual orientation- except that some may find what it really is when they are drunk (repressed inhibition released).  Nonsense- this simply is not true.  I suppose it is a waste of time to try and tell you to understand what a study presents.  Most of what you cite does not extrapolate anything, you do.   If people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress other's and leave our private lives to ourselves, I would have no support for laws and rules to protect people form this.  But we need only look at post such as yours to see that they lack rational thought and intelligent outlooks.

       This can be turned around.  The Austrians who should feel guilty about  their actions during WWII, but don't, justify their anti-semetism by making  every Israeli action into an atrocity.  The Austrians, Germans and other  Europeans have extensive trading relations with the Arab block; being   pro-Arab is good for business.  I don't think that ethics has a thing to  do about it.
I was one of the unfortunate people to run into this guy.  I sent him $30 cash (Stupid, I know) for 4 CDs.  That was the last I heard of him.  I know there were some other people ripped off by this guy.  Has there been any advances in tracking him down?
 The people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing press releases.  This is not a high-manpower project; they don't *have* spare people sitting around.  As I understand it, there has also been some feeling on the part of some of the project management that publicity was not a good idea.  A lot of people have been working on changing this view, with some success.
"CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS"                                     by: Hank Hanegraaff             "Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin.             Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command."                                        -Dr. Walter Martin   Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest  evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. In this skillful,  careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and  examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly  compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian  faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic.  In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith  movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of "another gospel"  (Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick K.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David)  Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and  Jan Crouch).  The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should be in most Christian Book Stores soon. You can order a hard-back copy  through CRI for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail  mark-ups.  The Christian Research Journal, which is a quarterly publication by CRI  has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, "What's  Wrong With The Word Faith Movement?" This is a good article that will  inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your  book arrives. If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself,  you can order it from CRI at the number above for $14 a year. It is the  best source of the most-accurate and well-researched info in Christiandom  today.
  Though this will be addressed in the series of articles I'm posting now under "ARESNOKOITIA", I can't wait.  This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim 1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals."  The decalogue, above everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe in absolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul reveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read "Jehovah's Anointed Savior."     In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards) is not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for application in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away with.   This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being posted.  Please refer to it.   We can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against the statement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours.   Again read the article because it uses facts.   I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend, yet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is no remorse, then I feel that Paul's "pastoral" care, as presented in the Corinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer, then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays the present "political correctness" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how the morals decay.    I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax incentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment. --Rex
 Well, let me see if I can explain it.  It's similar to collecting coins, or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about everything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really; it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.  Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you use your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect.  It's just personal preference.  Oops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that any more, are we?
I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles. I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring early summer is the best time to buy.
I'm not familiar at all with the format of these "X-Face:" thingies, but after seeing them in some folks' headers, I've *got* to *see* them (and maybe make one of my own)!  I've got "dpg-view" on my Linux box (which displays "uncompressed X-Faces") and I've managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that I'm *looking* for them, I can't seem to find any X-Face:'s in anyones news headers!  :-(  Could you, would you, please send me your "X-Face:" header?  I *know* I'll probably get a little swamped, but I can handle it.  	...I hope.
 In a word, yes.
 I've just spent two solid months arguing that no such thing as an objective moral system exists.
 Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read  "The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing  by this "hated" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.   Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute  it.  What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic  infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial  competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida  blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as  the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to  both mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers  this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that  your nutrition course does not, too bad.      My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you  noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point  out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,  pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist  and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of  Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.  You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small  little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in  Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what  I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into  "The Yeast Connection" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain  and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never  written.

Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify a color for drawing, like  Drawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or Fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color)   With X, I have to do something like  XSetForeground(current_color) XDrawPoint(d,w,x,y)  Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on?
 You *know* that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is *only* going to generate flames, not discussion. Try adding some substance to the issue of "gestures" you mentioned.  What is it you feel that Israel *has* offered as a "gesture"? What would you (*realistically*) expect to see presented by the Arabs/Palestinians in the way of "gesture"?   What are the "rules" that have been bent by Arab actions? It would seem that the Israeli deportations were seen by the other side as an example of "changing the rules".

This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine. The first fully international issue has been published and echoes  are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si).   Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993  Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you  will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse.    A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology  (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question.    On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional  achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the  understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.    The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.    Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.    E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job.  At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and  philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means.  Sincerely yours,

Hi sci.med folks...  I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium.  I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  She has been having difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  I would like to  know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy.  I have a booklet from the "Lithium Information Center" based at the  University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be interested in comments from the "not necessarily PRO" side of the fence.  I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed...  Thanks for any information you can provide.  Please email me directly...
 It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec) into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time first.   DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this problem.  -- Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com
I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS  Headlight covers.  Actually, they are turning signal covers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights. I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light  blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning signal covers in stock.  I asked how much it would be and he told me it would cost me another $40.  I thought this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic. Can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?
Hi, I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission. Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless  I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound. The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say  this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT? And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse:    1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.    2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is       fully depressed.    3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.    4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if       it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)    5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),       while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.    6- The shifter acted normally after that.  When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the  clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.  I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because  Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car.   In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage, and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck.  I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting  from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get  the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems,  and with how to handle Mitsubishi.   All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to bore you with the long post.
I am writing a X-based dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent.  I found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong.   If I run the program on a Linux host(XFree1.2) with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to the Sun host (X11R5), the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different.  Of course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K.  Can anybody verify this ?     Did I do anything wrong ?  	 Thanks.

Recently, I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my computer.  It doesn't happen everytime I turn it on, nor can I predict when it is going to happen.  I have an AMI BIOS and all of the setting are lost, for example the drive types and the password options.  However, the date and time remain correct.  If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.

Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.  2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly.  3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).  4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.  6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.       After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink, a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence.  7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).  2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU) 	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU) 	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour 	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km 	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds  SPECIAL TOPIC
[stuff deleted] I have a similiar question relating to anti-alaising that my friend has asked to have posted to the more knowledgable in this group. I'm sorry if this is an FAQ.

Does any one know of a decent quality library of routines for performing 3D graphics modelling on the PC?  Ideally the routines would be embeded in our application program.  Requirements (wish list): - flat surface modelling (simple phong shading optional) - ability to plot hidden-line drawings - Texture mapping -- both procedural and bit map - modeling light sources (local, distant, and spot lights) - Ray-tracing - Radiosity (optional)  Any comments would be appreciated.

Tom Clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from building a nuclear bomb.  However, he asserts that you can find these key steps in any university library.  The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_ is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible materials are nearly impossible to control.  Read this article, or better yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a nuclear weapon.  Doug Holland

 The "artist renderings" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't  appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.  Thanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints.  That would  explain the similar design on UARS.   Heck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind. The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement for the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A  second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.
 There should be no problem with this - just remember to get the number of wait states correct!   Guy
: I have seen various references to 'triple des' recently. Could anyone : tell me what it is ? From context, I would guess that it means : encrypting each block 3 times, with a different key each time, but : I'd like to be sure.  : Replies by email preferred - our news is unreliable.  Could people replying to the above question post their responses here as well, as I'm sure others (including myself) would like to hear them.  Thanks.  Jon
 Oh yeah, all the time.  On a nice spring/summer day, I roll down the window and drive around looking for bikes.  When a bike motors by in the opposite direction, I stick my arm out and hi5'em.  My arm feels like a million  bucks when I'm doing this a 60km/h.  I do the same thing with cyclists. The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane. I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  Oh well, I  think they appreciate the thought.   Regards, Ted.
  Thanks, Jody. I can't say I've ever seen it summed up so succinctly before.    I might only add two things.... stupid road design (or poor, at least) and we deal with it for the fun and *brotherhood* we share with others who take  their lives in their hads to feel the wind in their hair....IMHO.

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain.  Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have to be extracted surgically.  When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less.
Where can I find it ?
 Hmmm.  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria, and your response was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'.  You never did counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria.  One wonders who's playing semantic games, here.   --  Rick Schaut UUCP:...{uunet | uw-beaver}!microsoft!richs
This is the AP story from Fri morning.  As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and  checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the     compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.    This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the  six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world     since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's  phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.     They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what     was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to  find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.   Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of  propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house, it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked  together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness.

 We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping, no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also,  recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth  operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place  as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended  lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).   My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable  instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard. There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally  looking back at me.    "Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.   Exactly: nobody can look quite as silly as we can.
 All right! Let's hope they get off their rear ends and do something because the UN clearly is content to sit on its.

My  thoughts and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's  victims.  The law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege  recommended the course of action pursued today.  The Attorney  General informed me of their analysis and judgment and  recommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks  of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely.  I told the  Attorney General to do what she thought was right, and I stand by  that decision.
  Your post is based on the premise that the laws as they stand do not discriminate anybody, so your argument falls over immediately.  Are you really that dumb as to use emotive language to prove an argument? Please feel free to answer, that is, if you have anything intelligent to say on the matter.
  Do I ever!!!!!!  After 2 years of having health problems that had been cleared up w/allery shots, and not knowing why, I went and was re-tested. I actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago.... Then putting 2 + 2 together, I realized that it all started back up when the laser printer came into the office.  I kept track of the usage, and on hi use days, I was worse.  I got better over the weekends....  The laser printer is gone, I'm 100% better!!!..... Whether it is the toner dust or chemicals, I dont know (I am highly allergic to dust...), but it definitely was the laser printer....    		     brenda peters 		     carderock div, nswc, david taylor model basin 		     bethesda, md  20084  		     e-mail :   cape@dtvms.dt.navy.mil 				 or

 : To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips:  : 	What are they like during the summer? Yes, you : 	wiseguy, I mean while they are off!  : 	Are they comfortable? Do they transmit a lot of : 	vibration? How do they compare to the stock grips? : 	To foam grips?   : Do they really make a difference during the winter?  I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed.  As far as I can tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips.  They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated grips were *great*.  I've only had the bike a month and the heated grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.
 Not this again.
 No, which is why I want an investigation.      Who ever said he was? What is obvious is that he was defending himself, and his followers, from the government.  Whether you think he was right or wrong in this is another question.  If he was right, then he had the moral right to kill those kgBATF agents. --Ray Cote
 They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new grille.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.  Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the LEXUS and hence, they now join the pack.  I still wonder if much of the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial AD campaign.  Personally, I like the Q without the Grille.
   True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church   leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach   was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the    BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole   theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces    of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds   played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound   with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them    they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was   evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up    a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they   broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving    relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'   childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender   seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.

Howdy All!  I have recently converted to Microsoft Visual C++.  I no longer want my Borland C++ 3.1 w/Application Frameworks product.  This version is about 6 months old. I have all of the manuals, disks (5.25"), etc. It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement.  I also have a copy of the books:  "Developing Windows Applications with Borland C++ 3", James McCord, Sams (39.95) "Using Borland C++ 3 2nd ed", Mark & Lee Atkinson", Que  (29.95)  I'd like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed below.  I'll ship C.O.D. to anywhere in the U.S. via the shipper of your choice (provided they are local to me), and I will pay the COD charges (you just pay for the shipping).  The list price for the product is about $750. I have seen it advertised for as low as $500.   I will accept the best offer over $375 (plus shipping as described above) which is 1/2 the list price, plus, I'm tossing in the 2 books listed above (which are a $70 value).  I will hold the bidding open through the weekend and close it sometime in the evening of 4/26/93.  Please reply via eMail. Only serious offers please apply. No, I will not consider anything for trade, nor any offers less then $375 as I consider it a fair price.    Regards, Steve.
     I have indeed heard of Pythagoras, but I don't know that he was ever disparaged as a "bean eater".  In the American Southwest and West (e.g., Texas, California, Colorado), the term "bean eater" is sometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage (generally Mexicans, in those parts) -- much like how the Irish in the Northeast are perceived (by some) as voracious beer guzzlers.
In September 1990, our medical reserve unit was sent to the KETZIOT prison camp to take care of Arab prisoner who were housed in 5 sections of 1500 prisoners each, with each section subdivided in 5 units housing 300 prisoners. The prisoners would "communicate" with other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by taking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing them with incredible precision to other sections. I should have been a recruiter for the Red Sox :-) There were at least three prisoners who could have been outstanding pitchers.

Hi, 	I am looking for a very high speed  D/A converter (at least 8bits and 150MHz) for a research application. A paper in  the January issue of IEEE Solid-State Circuits mentions a  GaAs, 1GHz, 8bit DAC - anyone know where I can find such a thing? Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would do. 	Needless to say, I have looked in all the conventional places (Vitesse, Motorola, National, etc. etc.). Any pointers would be appreciated.

 At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either.  I was more than a little worried about Viola's elbow.  But you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola instead.  Now I'm even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.   How long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I think they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.  Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any automatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?f

Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:  (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...]  The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again, application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of gay Christians is largeely specious. *** Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).  what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse   at all.

 In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there, and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).  While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway),  it is incidental to their reaction.
I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the logic board.  I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two  other chips.  I'd like to know more about it.  Could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it?  Thanks a bunch.  1.	What does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)? 2.	What are the technical details of the re-work?  (I'm looking for 	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected, 	and the pin-outs for those chips.) 3.	Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without? 4.	Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of 	the operating system?  	and, finally,  5.	Should I even be concerned about any of this?
Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and relaunching it:  (Caution: speculation mode engaged) There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet. I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses...)  I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged (I assume that they were caged for launch)?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Corvin 	      				zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com GN&C R&D					Martin Marietta Astronautics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ===============    My views, not Martin Marietta's   ========================
I'm working on an audio mixer project, but I'm having trouble finding parts.  I want to use op-amps for the gain control stages.  The ones I have found that are good for audio are LM739 and LM833, but I cannot find either of these in the electronic parts places I've looked.  Are there any good substitute op-amps and/or are there any parts suppliers in the LA area that carry this kind of thing (10KOhm dual audio taper slider pots would be nice, too).  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
   Is there an "official DoD products-of-choice" list?  If so would the  appropriate party please post it.    -Erc.
 It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW they have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections. Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.  Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.  I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.   Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored! Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.  And to answer your question, I "broke" with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition members.   Fair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument. If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not be.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.  As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter stands/was resolved.  Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions and groundless justifications.   For the record, Roni Milo, is a brash MK (self described) from the Likud (note NOT LABOR).  Quite frankly, I don't think anything he would say could surprise me.  Annoy and aggravate, yes, surprise - no.   Yes I do and thank you for providing it.  I would be most interested in knowing how things turned out.  Anyone......?
Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting to get a composite sync signal on the "green"?  There ought to be a little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert, and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all 1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.  Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?

 Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean. Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left. To do this, you have to push against something, and the only thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well, the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the  ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to  the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground  pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.   The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing  problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end),  but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel  toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the  wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter- steering.

 RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.    After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up, they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life.   a Whatever it is,  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on HST ops.
Go with the Mercedes, if you can afford it.  I think the 300 wagon starts around 50k, although it could be 60k.  There is no comparison with any of the other cars listed.
 A Yugo that will go 1/4mi in 7.7 seconds will _not_ lose on the street. That's just too damn quick. It might be wrapped around a telephone pole at the end of that quarter mile, but it will be there alone...   Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_ MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than the sticker price of either.   Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.   Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.  Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the "pony car" class came from) with a performance model. That's why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet  accessible--with room for performance tweaking.  The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche, and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least, does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.  				James

My questions:   	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed? 	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)?  	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?  I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display 1028x768(?) with my 486.

   I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume that the general public "can't handle the truth" and then, based on this  assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a good argument, comes along and asks "why don't you just develop the spinoffs?" or "why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the military?"  There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.   And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right. Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was  conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.

Hi there, maybe you can help me...  I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox seems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also  somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as bad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it just be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid. Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...
 In a word, yes.  1989 Bonnevilles prices (avg. retail):
When constructing active filters,  odd values of resistor are often required  (i.e. something like a 3.14 K Ohm resistor).(It seems best to choose common  capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).  Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade?.(1, 1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc ).  It is a common enough problem,  yet I cant  recall seing a program that tells that Rx+Ry//Rz gives Rq,  starting with  q and finding prefered values x,y and z.
 That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our "founding    fathers," but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were    revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the    American psyche.    ...       By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the    Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited    forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors    on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged    his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at    Albany Congress: "It would be a strange thing...if six nations    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted    for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should    be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies."       According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs    and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he    acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy."

I have a Logitech 256grays hand scanner from a PC.  I'm wondering if anyone has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac?  It has the same connector and is a serial device on the pc.  I can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed, but I'm not sure if the signal levels would be correct, and if the mac s/w would work with it.    Of course the manuals say nothing about the interface, connector layout or anything H/W-ish!  Any ideas??   thanx,
    Check into the vopl and vogle libraries.  I beleive that I still have them available on ftp.c-mols.siu.edu but I'm not sure.  I haven't seen any new announcements for the software but I'm sure it's still around.  I have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as just for producing graphs after the fact.  It works well and supports numerous graphics output formats (including X.)  I tried it and liked it.  YOu may as well.
  It is still incestuous.... :)
folks,  I have a Panasonic kx-1124 (just inherited with no documentation) which is  giving me a problem that i cant resolve.   The paper out light refuses to go out . It starts to blink when ever i turn the power on which 2 beeps. It does allow be to go on line with green light lit, simultanously the red paper out light also remains lit -but is does not blink.   Please do not give any references to manuals , as i dont have any.  Thanking you all very much in advance.  Sincerely

 You don't say what kind of "electronic equipment" you mean.  It's hard to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't do things like washing lubricant out of switches.  When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for several days to be damn sure.  I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.  I would be very wary of CCl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even if it's not going to harm the equipment -- not only is it poisonous, but I believe it's now known to be carcinogenic.
 That study which was in the NEJM, I think, noted that the frequency of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in California (I guess richer people have more heart disease in  California -) ) whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over seventy in Canada was relatively uniform across income distribution. Heart surgery was more frequent in California, but mortality and outcomes were essentially the same.   The only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the self-referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial interest in it, which is basically unethical...but in Canada because of our small population, there is likely only to be a few private facilities involving only a small number of doctors, and thus I don't think the self-referral problem, which is an epidemic in the US, could ever get out of hand here.   It is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully.   What likely happened is the sponsors of the private MRI which include doctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's, and instead of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another one or two, saw a business opportunity...where they would have a secure business from the public insurance side of things, and they could supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash.
 As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I  was there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments. He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline, to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick to your clothes. Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural' lotion.

        ^^^^^^^^^^  The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.  As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.

 	I'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so neatly, or at all.  A myth is more than a single story.  The thought  structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as important a part of the myth as the story itself.  Thus, I can think of no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical "truths" along with it.
   Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)... I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra "junk" put out by them was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install than "cats".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels are cleaner otherwise.  BTW, (I named my subject "Dirty Diesels" because I knew it would get a reaction out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd read it...) --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Vel Natarajan  nataraja@rtsg.mot.com  Motorola Cellular, Arlington Hts IL  --

 I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old. Some screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy".  This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just unlucky!  Regards,  Kate.  :)|
 Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity.  In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.  Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
If this man Clark is a NASA administrator then god save NASA. Of course the Shuttles record is unrivaled !  There is only one Shuttle. Furthermore, there is only likely to be one Shuttle now that Hermes and Boron are  effectively cancelled.  These officials should spend more of their time explaining to their European and Asian partners how we are expected to believe in them when their paymasters change their minds on major international projects everytime a new US administration takes office (considering the major impacts this has on the European and Asian (Japanese) industry). It is also appreciated how this affects American industry. I am of course talking about Space Stattion Freedom.
We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:  1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?  2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies?  3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit?  4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders?  Please post replies here or send E-mail to me at: 	fennell@well.sf.ca.us Thanak you very much for any assistance you can provide.

    Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of  power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take  an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)   [talking about Impala SS]  Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17" aluminum rims and Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read:  plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

 [much BS deleted for brevity]   It certainly smacks of that! Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.  Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very  unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that OS.   That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more  defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage this too, IMHO.  Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing. I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ...

It seems that there are more and more "bands" available for police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.    Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering.    So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the new Super Ka wideband.    Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be  worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the  market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar  bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.
 It is easy for Sen. Biden to say that when there are no US troops in Zepa or Srebinica or Sarejevo...

 Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.   I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and renovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year!

 	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650 front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000) 2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were  free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask, but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear axels, ford 9" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i  busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and  haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to  rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad, i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over 3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too. One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it.
One point not yet mentioned: 	Hands on the driver's shoulders are a definite no-no.  It feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms, and a shoulder massage feels good too, but the shoulders are connected to the arms, and the arms to the handlebars...  Should you hit the brakes, the pressure on the shoulders can make steering interesting.  Bundle her up if it's cold, make sure she has good gear (say it again), an pat her thigh to let her know all is great.
 You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason. It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has no propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity, given that there may not be another visit for several years.
   I once wrote such a program (in BBC basic...) It was very crude, and took around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of  intelligence), and told you the best combination >Rq and the best below Rq.  If you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and then search the solution space using three nested loops. I'm sure you could knock this up in an hour.  Christopher

  Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond refresh rates common.  So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.   Steve

In the following report: _Turkey Eyes Regional Role_ ANKARA, Turkey (AP) April 27, 1993, we find in the last paragraph:  [Turanist] Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozal's often [Turanist] brash calls for more Turkish influence, he also has spoken [Turanist] of a swath of Turkic peoples "stretching from the Adriatic [Turanist] Sea to the Great Wall of China."  Who does Demirel think he is fooling? It seems at both ends of his envisioned  pan-Turkic Empire -- the Balkans and the Caucasus -- Turkey's fascist boasts are being pre-empted.  I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their "Grey Wolf Teeth", and attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China! Turkey will have cried "wolf" just once too much!

        It's possible to make boards in other colors, and I have an ad for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your choice of Day-Glo (tm) colors.         The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas. The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and I suspect that color is a dye.
 I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS -- I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?  For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin for "candida hypersensitivity syndrome."  It was published in the  New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections to the study, though I don't remember what they were.
Can some kind soul provide me with information on LDRs that contain an onboard light-source, in a totally integrated and light-shielded unit.  I have seen a VTL5C LDR in some schematics.

  	I'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the GS550B and, I think, the GT380M) I was able to pop a Cibie' insert directly into the original housing (held in by those roughly W-shaped springs).  The inserts used 55/60W halogen bulbs, and were great, although Mr Bill later indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.
 Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good) perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses) overcame and enveloped them?  In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?  Does that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...

Hi!  I am looking for a source of lithium batteries for an original Mac II.  The number on the battery is ER 1/2 AA.  Local electronic shops & computer stores freak when inquire.  The fastest any of them can get a battery to me is 2-3 weeks for about $20.  Anything faster and/or cheaper is welcome!  Please respond to me via e-mail and I will summarize to the net.  Note my e-mail address differs from the return address of this posting.  Thanks in advance for your help!

:I tried this code yesterday.  On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over :300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech.  This means that it :needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable :in even a half-duplex mode.  Ouch!  Thanks for trying it.  :I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application.  It produces :great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads.  We want :something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's :without DSP cards.  My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be :a better starting point.  Yes.  I'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but I've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample) plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into 14.4K with a simdgen left over.  This is *definitely* worth working on, folks.  And shorten works in well under real-time.

If anybody has one what do you think about it? I will also get a cyrix math co with it.  I have benchmarks for the two chips a nd they look very good for the price.  If anybody responds please send me email  because I usually don't check the mail very often but I check my reader daily.     Thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp laints or praise, not just to Cyrix/AMD bash.  I know about what Byte, computer  shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why I am considering the Cyrix chip.  Thanks.........
 There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini.   It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.   Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is *not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.
 It sounds as though you might want to try a product such as "super-glue". The active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct bones.  I have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many different species of animal. If you are simply trying to adhear something to bone for several months, this would be ideal. It bonds almost immediatly, is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.

 Owwww!!  Mr. Jefferson would be clearly disappointed in your designation of  him as author of the bill of rights.  And your reference to those in Israel was condesceding and inappropriate. The Declaratio of Independence of 1776 was written by Thomas Jefferson. In 1787, the Constitution was drafted by 55 men in Philadelphia. In 1791, the Bill of Rights was added.  Well, maybe Jefferson would be flattered.  As to you guys at UVA, your right, not all of you are anti-Jewish, or self-hating.  But when I visited Charlottesville, I noticed a distinct lack of diversity, from which I must assume you garner your inability to perceive the reality of the outside world.

 Sorry, but this is a red herring.  Are you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue Cross?  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between the two sets of forms.    Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid, the two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies.   (5% versus 14%-16%).  If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees, post it.  Otherwise, try to stick to factual assertions.   Well now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system. Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents  private insurance companies from "standardizing?"  In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the  lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US, but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than "free enterprise" at work.    By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a single-payer system is always cheaper...".  Guess even the "free enterprise advocates" are beginning to see the light.  Sorry, but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care reform with the Bush administration's gag order on federally funded family planning clinics.  There are no proposals that would control what your "doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures."  Try again.  jsh

This only happens to the text over the fill. Text adjecent in a different box is uneffected.  Any ideas?

Hello,  recently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk.  I didn't notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of  the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files. I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just  something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Hello All!      It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking - secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?   Chris

om>   Cliff, do you know the difference between "Windows" and "Win-OS/2"?  Here's a helpful hint:  Running "Windows" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1 no longer has a "real mode".  The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added by IBM to "Win-OS/2".  Now, everybody who is running "Windows" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2 2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running "Win-OS/2" under OS/2, raise YOUR hand.  Get the picture, Cliff?
HELP!  I am trying to find software that will allow COM port redirection under Windows for Workgroups.  Can anyone out there make a suggestion or reccommend something.

 Please do not do this!  I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so.  Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP.  Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I didn't want in the first place.  If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.
I get the picture, I just find it humorous that Running Windows 3.1 apps ( 3.0 for 2.0 )  is what makes os/2 more credible...

    There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.  The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document to them for high resolution printing or ripping.  Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really for dot matrix or your own lazer printer. However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program to ATM fonts for high end stuff.  If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted your money!

This information is free.	 You get more than what you pay for. 	      Don't sue me if I'm wrong.       OVERVIEW      The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent  Bitmap"     file  format.  (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to     me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit     pixels.      These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.     If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-     swap all short and long integer values.      By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".   This  is  because    			      March 15, 1991      				    - 2 -       they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  Consequently you     will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.      Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  DIB     images: 	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the 	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for 	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment. 	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor 	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager. 	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.                                         			      March 15, 1991      				    - 3 -       DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS      The DOS DIB images consist of: 	 1.  A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file	 as  a 	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image 	     file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2.  A "BITMAPINFOHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image 	     attributes. 	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists, 	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows 	     RGBQUAD structure. 	 4.  The image data itself.       The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 	 1.  The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file 	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the 	     image file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2.  A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image 	     attributes. 	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this 	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a 	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. 	 4.  The image data itself.       The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header 	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value. 	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of 	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a 	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header 	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER). 	 3.  The image data itself.       CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.      Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.     The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header     structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file.     Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit     images.  The five general steps are: 	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER 	     structures the basic image information. 	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the 	     color palette of RGBQUADS. 	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in    			      March 15, 1991      				    - 4 -   	     the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the 	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfOffBits"	field  of  the 	     BITMAPFILEHEADER. 	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER, 	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).      The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-     defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those     not familiar with MicroSoft C.  		     _______________________________________ 		    |					   | 		    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.| 		    |______________________________________| 		    | typedef |	 meaning		   | 		    |_________|____________________________| 		    | BYTE    |	 unsigned character	   | 		    | WORD    |	 two byte unsigned integer | 		    | DWORD   |	 four byte unsigned integer| 		    |_________|____________________________|                                 			      March 15, 1991      				    - 5 -       THE BITMAPFILEHEADER      This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { 		 WORD	 bfType; 		 DWORD	 bfSize; 		 WORD	 bfReserved1; 		 WORD	 bfReserved2; 		 DWORD	 bfOffBits; 	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;      The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves     to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered     machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the     quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.      The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this     field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the     BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times     the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the     image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be     calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in     later.      Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to     zero.      The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data     from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set     to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the     BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times     the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written     write after the color palette if one exists.                   			      March 15, 1991      				    - 6 -       THE BITMAPINFOHEADER      This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ 		 DWORD	 biSize; 		 DWORD	 biWidth; 		 DWORD	 biHeight; 		 WORD	 biPlanes; 		 WORD	 biBitCount; 		 DWORD	 biCompression; 		 DWORD	 biSizeImage; 		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter; 		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter; 		 DWORD	 biClrUsed; 		 DWORD	 biClrImportant; 	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;      The "biSize" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure     itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to     determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a     BITMAPCOREHEADER.      The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.      The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.      The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out     as if there was one color plane.      The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either     1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.      The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is     compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.     However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how     it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the     data is not compressed.      All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to     zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to     compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.      The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed".     For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the     possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biClrUsed"     colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may     only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set     this field to zero.    			      March 15, 1991      				    - 7 -       COLOR PALETTES      Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD     structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as: 	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { 		 BYTE	 rgbBlue; 		 BYTE	 rgbGreen; 		 BYTE	 rgbRed; 		 BYTE	 rgbReserved; 	 } RGBQUAD;     The "rgbReserved" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount     of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is     written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  "rgbBlue",  "rgbGreen",  or     "rgbRed"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not     contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these     fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color     composition.        IMAGE DATA      There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image     file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and     certainly was.      Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four     byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel     wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The     number of bytes per line can be calculated as:  		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;  	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---  		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;       When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.     The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the     first line of image data in the file.      For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would     expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit     images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one     pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.     However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the     order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in    			      March 15, 1991      				    - 8 -       an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "BGR"     ordering.      SUMMARY      This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from     applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you     find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me     so that I can modify this document accordingly.

Hi,  I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events, so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in  some sort of 'preferences' file.  I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:   XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);  This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).  However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct.  When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.  Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?  Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?  I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x, y, width, height resources.  Thanks --
HELP!  I am trying to view .JPG files with my 386SX, 20MHz machine .  I have a STB-POWERGRAPH graphics card with 1024 X 768 by 256 colors, with 1Meg RAM on it.  I have tried CVIEW097 (with windows-- EXTREMELY SLOW), and DVPEG24. DVPEG24 doesn't work!  Even if I pick a lot of the "modes" that are supported by POWERGRAPH (so it says in the manual), it doesn't work when I try to view a picture... it only buzzes.  Anyone out there that can help me; give me suggestions?  I would really appreciate it!
 This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file (.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.
I just bought a new AMIECU EISA motherboard and an Adaptec 1742A fast-SCSI  controller. I wanted to install the AHA-1742A and did as written in the AMIECU manual. But the CFG-utility told me to get a newer version of the Adaptec  configuration overlay file named 'adp0000.ovr', because the old one is not  compatible to my motherboard. The adaptec driver utility is version 3.0.         CAN YOU HELP ME ? PLEASE DO SO.
Hello Xperts out there. I've just built X11R5 for SunOS 4.1.1/SPARC. I have gcc-2.2 and I'd like to use its 64-bit capability to generate an X11 release which will render to the frame buffer using store-double (64-bit) machine code. Can anyone tell me which directories/source files/ compiler switches to begin with?  thanks in advance
Hello,  I was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume it would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.  I looked at export ( @ mit ) in the index of /contrib, but didn't find anything  relevant.
We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our lab.  However, I am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing  a scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg. I have tried scanning at a  higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice.   However, the printed version is coming out ugly!    Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are  there tricks involved to get better quality?   Or should we be  getting something (like PhotoShop) to "pretty up" the image? I will appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks in advance,  -Kris

  I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection. As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a CD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.  Hmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You would need a tonne of disks though.
 You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the notepad for it to do this though.
A friend of mine uses Windows 3.1 to do most of her work. Unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven't been able to figure out how to change the default font used by the system and application menus, or the font used by the Help program (what use is hypertext if you can't read it?) to make it legible to her.  If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts, of any software package that makes Windows more accessible to visually handicapped people, please let me know.

I recently set Windows 3.1 up on my 486DX-33 VLB system, and I didn't notice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control panel.  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced mode (whether I wanted it or not).  Now I've got a program that I  just bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be running Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard mode).  How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows to not want to give you enhanced mode?   Thanks for any help!!
Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 15-May-93 Re: COLORS and X windows (A.. John Cwikla@morrison.wri (4620)    What I'd like to see is this scenario:   Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette.  Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information.  They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors.   When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER.   A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette.
 I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary, it was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps   Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms. NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections, NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.  I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement it.  If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

Hi people!:     I'm looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows.    I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but I'd like to be  aware of other choices.    Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?    And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive  pricing ?    What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?    Any info is welcome.      Thanx in advance.     C U!     By(e)
Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group does its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations with SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2 apps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.
Hi,  	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988 keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching). It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386 enhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and when trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.  	Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?  Much thanks appreciated.

The Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation (blurb) states that the user must separately acquire the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), which contains the Windows tools to build the drivers. If we are using Borland C++ with Application Frameworks, is this necessary? We also have a copy of the Microsoft Press Programmer's Reference Library (books) which normally comes with the SDK, and Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.0. Why is the SDK neccessary for development of Virtual Device Drivers?

How can one dump to the printer, the content of a VGA screen. If it were a text screen, we can execute a shift printscr. but with graphics, we have to do a pixed by pixel print. It would be greatly appreciated if someone can supply source code for this. Alternately, are there commercial or shareware programs that are available to do this. I must be able to shell out of my  program to execute this print screen.  Therefore, it would be prefferable to have source code.  Thank you in advance  --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rickey Tom                       | Internet Style: aruba!rickt@uu2.psi.com Programmer/Analyst Project ZE    | UUCP          : ...!uunet!uupsi2!aruba!rickt
)Many high-end graphics cards come with C source code for doing basic graphics )sorts of things (change colors, draw points/lines/polygons/fills, etc.).  Does )such a library exist for generic VGA graphics cards/chips, hopefully in the )public domain?  This would be for the purpose of compiling under a non-DOS )operating system running on a standard PC.  Check the server code for X11R5.  (or "XFree86")
I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.  I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay, performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.  Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either.  Any help would be appreciated.
I'm quite familiar with a variety of window title *setting* methods.  My question is...  Is there any way (via Resources, etc) to stop an application's ability to re-name it's own Name / IconName properties?  ...who cares if it's not 'nice' to the application -  	I WANT CONTROL! ;-)  -Mike
    I didn't say the program is DISABLED, did I?  (I HATE!!!! it when people take my words out of context...)  I mean that once you have installed it, you cannot DEinstall it without registering it, or transfer it to another machine, or SOME SORT OF LIMITATION (the author will decide), WHICH WILL BE REMOVED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS REGISTERED.
  I have successfully copied all of the uuencoded versions of these logos to my local directory, but when I tried the GIF files, it said "Permission denied". Could you explain why, and also how to execute the uuencoded files?  Thanks,  Ken
I have a very large (3x5 feet) file in Macintosh Canvas v2.something which I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least disk-space intensive way possible.  (i.e. EPS is a big problem, since it took 1.3 MEG to encode one page of the document)  The file is entirely lines and words.  I have access to networked Macs & PC's, and ftp.  Can anyone suggest how this might be accomplished?  Email replies, if you would, I don't read this group much. Thanks in advance.
I've found that I have to add the "-8" option for displaying JPEGs with the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into 24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors  (from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it could tell that.
Greetings, 	We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.  	When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged.    	Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server).   	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? 	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? 	How about obvious gimmes? 	And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?  	Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is gorgeous. Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode features of TT fonts (in Windows NT).  I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts; I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts). Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first looks better.  I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !
The Andrew Consortium           of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon                           is pleased to announce                            AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2                                  4/26/93  The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address below.   The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host.  Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.  -----------  The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects, including text.  AUIS has three components:      The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set     of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help     system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell     interface, and other editors corresponding to the various     available types of objects.       The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented     user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein     objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,     programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as     easily as those that come with the system.       The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface     to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail     management strategies and implements many advanced  features     including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of     mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails     of related messages, and subscription management. It also     provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and     low-function personal computers in addition to high-function     workstations.   The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.   Remote Andrew Demo Service  You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups.  To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command on your machine:  	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu  The service will give you further instructions.

I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra (the old mach8 chip).  I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have one problem.  When using windows in 800x600, I have noticed that the  tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I was using the Trident card.  Is there a setting in my .ini files that I can change to make these smaller ?  I could not find the FAQ for this list...  		--Mike
Hello,  I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help me with it. I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well. 'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some  experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back. I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet. I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53) SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4. Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to other machines but that's not what I did it for.
I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.   For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending  on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted.  The  rest of the desktop is fine.  For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I  have no problem.  I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no  problems with, so it is possible.  It is also possible to display these bitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video  card is not at fault.  How can I remedy this?  My system:       386DX40, 4Mb ram.      DOS 6.0, Windows 3.1.      Oak 1Mb 077 Video card, 1024x768x256 mode, using supplied drivers.      Windows has a permanent 11,288kb swap file.  Please reply via e-mail, and _use the address in my .sig_, as our post  software always seems to mangle the address in the header.      Thanks,           Mazz.

At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3 and OpenWindows 2.0.  This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2 display, I can't open the compose window.  I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes, we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs.  Is there a "ready to go" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself?  Any help is welcome  	V. Smeets
I was just wondering if anyone new how I could get the BETA version of Windows NT, and be part of the BETA program.    Thanks  gel@binkley.cs.mcgill.ca
I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an  individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2 and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one. I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won the single user PC war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0. Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II' of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure  is fun watching and arguing about it tho. Thx Dave L
We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for PC (presumably Windows) clients?  Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be  *much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP (with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.  -- Rob
< <>OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview <>requires DSC compliant PostScript files, in order to stop at page breaks. <>I don't consider that broken.  I say that any program that puts out a <>PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken. < <Well that may be true.  However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0 <does not mention about DSC compliance.  In any event, the point here <is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will <find out that it's not a practical tool.  It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview program does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it would stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go forward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?).  In any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.
 I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try scanning the index files).  To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a "Save as..."  Select "Windows bitmap" and "Compressed" (or is it "RLE"?) Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...  Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!
I am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon_ (former title: _Mormon's Book_) by Lynn Matthews Anderson is now available through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages (eliminating many extraneous "that's" and "of's"), and many (minor) errors have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story, testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a "Words-to-Know" glossary.  As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms.  Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound "first editions.") I will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out.  FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then "cd pub" (you won't see anything at all until you do).  "The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon" is currently available in postscript and RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the Macintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.  -r--r--r--  1 dba                   1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps -r--r--r--  1 dba                   1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf  For more information about how this project came about, please refer to my article in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled "Delighting in Plainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon."

Here's the situation:  At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file, which I then bring to work.  My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish.  I know that I can open a DOS window and do:  	 copy file.ps com1:  which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.  There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the documentation.  Anyone know how to do this?

Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color, say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.  My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created.  For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area.  What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a  re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?  Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???
Is there an easy (ie via shell commands) way to tell what the DISPLAY  environment variable is for any given client process?  Sometimes I can  get what I want by typing ps -axe if:    a. the client was invoked with a -display argument       or    b. DISPLAY is one of the first few variables defined in the environment       (actually I've never seen b. but it's there to illustrate the type        of thing I'm looking for)  Ultimately I wish to determine the number of displays that are simultaneously  running a given X application.  my system: SunOS 4.1.2 sun4c  thanks for any help,

I have been using WinQVT/Net 2.81 under Win3.1 (dos 5.0) for quite sometime without any problem.  I recently installed DOS 6.0 on my 386-40 PC and I cannot run WinQVT/Net any more.  I keep getting "Packet received for invalid port-reset sent" messages on the console window.  I can't get more than 1 telnet window and can't use ftp!!!     Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
I recently installed dos 5.0 on a few machines, and the users  claim that when they use the mouse often, the screen will blank, and the machine will lock up.  There are no viruses, they are not running any TSR's. (the mouse is a logitec 2 button)  Anybody got any ideas?  thanks

       Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being displyed on the monitor's tube.       Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any problems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off when I'm not actually working on the server itself.)

Hello,    I am considering buying the Hummingbird X-Windows software for a MS-Windows 3.1 PC (386-40MHZ, NE2000 Ethernet board).  Would anyone tell me if they are using this package in a similar environment and if they are happy with it?  I will be connecting to Sun SparcStation 10 running Sun OS 4.1.3.  Thanks very much,

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	"begin" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	"begin" line 	M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options 	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. 	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will 	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 	is listed below.  	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was 	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). 	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. 	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, 	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you 	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). 	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link 	2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two        headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports: 	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC 	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1  	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active 	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.  	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, 	but anyone should feel free to submit patches. 	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to 	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:  	Tseng ET4000 	Tseng ET3000 	Paradise PVGA1 	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of 		the PVGA1, and use its driver) 	Genoa GVGA 	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 	ATI 18800, 28800  	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, 	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 	256 color mode.  	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of 	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the 	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome 	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.  	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to 	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To 	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel 	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how 	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such 	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with 	future XFree86 releases.  	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, 	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the 	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not 	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. 	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond 	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions 	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). 	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.  	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA 	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the 	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It 	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset 	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot 	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested 	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not 	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 	working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?  	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards 	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available 	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).  	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact 	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.  	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> 	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?  	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory 	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- 	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each 	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- 	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled 	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code 	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). 	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer 	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, 	but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?  	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run 	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. 	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending 	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). 	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will 	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  	lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?  	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: 		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) 		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) 	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)  	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information 	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?  	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries 			under /XFree86/SVR4 		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/ISC 		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries 			under /pub/linux/packages/X11 		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries 			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries 			under /i386  	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may 	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will 	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take 	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were 	made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories  	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot 	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include 	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.  	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified 	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is 	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed 	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files  	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. 	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in 	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes  	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known 	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. 	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and 	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is 	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on 	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated 	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the 	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to 	David for inclusion in the database.  	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. 	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use 	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information 	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.  	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and 	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot 	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from 	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The 	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. 	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your 	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up 	      starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit  	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to 	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is 	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?  	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4 	Why won't my xterm run properly?  	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define 	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. 	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'  	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping 	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be 	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.  	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey 	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the 	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:  	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux  	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc 	jump libraries installed.  	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.  	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to 	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes 	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files 	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the 	-pn argument to X386.  	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major 	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not 	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit 	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but 	startx won't.  	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with 	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".  	For more detailed information, please read the file README present 	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?  	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is 	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. 	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library  	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. 	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a 	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), 	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include 	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro 	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are 	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these 	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS  	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the 	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite 	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see 	something like 		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of 		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: 		ANSICCOPTIONS= 	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death 	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because 	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must 	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:  	The original "gang of four": 		David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au> 		Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu> 		Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu> 		David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>  	Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems: 		Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach] 		Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD] 		Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]      e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.  	--------------------------------------------------  Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).
 Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?).  IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga. It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga. The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.  Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats (Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)
The subject says it all. I bought Adobe Type Manager and find it completely useless. I ftped some atm fonts and couldn't install them. What's the use? Are you supposed to be able to convert ATM fonts to Truetype?  If there's anyone out there who has this program and actually finds it  useful, enlighten me!

The second part is    posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about   system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in   comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are   included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three   sections of this document  before posting.              All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from   rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory    pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory   FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as   general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last   part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for   comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for   comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as    compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end   of  the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically    decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have    these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send   pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name"  in the body text where   "name" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.   general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the   subject "help" for more detailed instructions.            ====================   I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)  ====================           Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is    a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions   (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve   Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used   ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my   system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a   patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box   would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I   installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to   print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs.    P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.)            Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we   ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the   table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other   relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially   the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read   the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that   you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen   of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has   already made its way around the world three hundred times before,   and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any   newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself   with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup   news.announce.newusers.    HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1)                 comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,   a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists   for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ   lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and   comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part   will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are   available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the   pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this   document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named   as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by   "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is   stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use   either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command    to decompress it.  However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when    you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file   before sending it to you.              This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned   newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ   lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to   get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere   else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand.    It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a   particular question or comment should be posted.  Please   familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh   newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear   in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong   where.              To jump to a particular question search for   section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For   example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for   the string  "(2.1)".  To jump to a section instead of a question   use a zero for  the question number.    WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)        comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of    frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup   comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are   worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list   covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup   comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and    available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in    /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list    for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from   rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now   is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently   asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,   telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has   compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of   questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform   conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp   from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim   Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX   environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux   and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at   jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.    WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)          There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.    You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite   integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask   the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft   Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an   excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their   ways of  communicating.            Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your   mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too   :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering   silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one   that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of   Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a   question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,   normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question   to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered   by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few   network software designers.             Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post.    If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra   minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important   enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.    For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a   catch-all newsgroup.             The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in   this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs   where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications   (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought   to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps   unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.    Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases   all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions   about non-communications hardware including questions about what   software is necessary to make particular hardware work to   comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software   belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and   extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about   A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk   belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.             Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.    Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development   environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit   questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,   comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the   netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer   are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.              A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY   technical question about an application that actually begins to   delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent   example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly   compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)   might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.               For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to   comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We   understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to   get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to   buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and   religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is   too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is   Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not   specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.             Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the   comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.    Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more   thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI   are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a   Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place   and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in   comp.sys.mac.    4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF  THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND  WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?        No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as   frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to   the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in   System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium   for answering common questions like this one.              You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail   response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it   before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups   covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that   lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the   section of this document that answers their question with just the   click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to   someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they   can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.         ===   FTP  (2.0)   ===   WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)        The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,   freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),   mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu   (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several   others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove   them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from   the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was   notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the   less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless   otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document   should be available at the above sites.           To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians    should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se   (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in    the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).    Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),     ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).    Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au   (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese   users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp   (130.69.254.254).            A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).    This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,   developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things   that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material   at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other   sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple   system software.  Please read the various README documents   available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're   connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute   material you find here.    CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)        The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from   LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu).    The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH   INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available   from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the   words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your   message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files   you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using   the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a   message with just the text "help" (no quotes).    WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)        If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above   sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it   an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help."    Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,   America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server   in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi   (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,   the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of   thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as "archie"   (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what   you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions.    For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a   convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails   to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of   the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog   Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead.  Substring   searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many   erroneous matches add a ".*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.   "prog disi.*\.hqx"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in   .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does.            Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE   asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you   follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the   net where to find a particular piece of software.    CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)        No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from   comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please   refer to the first questions in this section to find out about   anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.    WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)        Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to   more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're   compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're   translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format   that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special   two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex   files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure   8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary   protocol.             How a file has been translated and compressed for   transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have   a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was   compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file   you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the   process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step   decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary   (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress   it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table   below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs   will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh   files as they are downloaded.  *************************************************************************** Suffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar  Extractors -------------------------------------------------------------------------- StuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                   Compact Pro|         X     X  Packit     |                           X UUTool     |                                                      X  MacCompress|                                X  SunTar     |               X     X     X                                X  BinHex 5.0 |                     X  BinHex 4.0 |               X  DiskDoubler|                           X                X  UnZip      |                                                   X  DiskCopy   |                                     X  macutil    |         X     X           X                X ***************************************************************************       A few notes on the decompressors:        StuffIt is a family of products that use several different   compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff   all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,   StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will   not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0.    You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt   Expander.                StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller   archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow   maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep   net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous   ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.              UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX   formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)   respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac   products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators   that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also   available by anonymous ftp.              Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to   decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading   them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the   Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be   automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress   everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0   archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an   archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if   a program does what you need it to do before you download all of   it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the   info-mac/unix directory.       A few notes on the compression formats:        .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file   transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.    Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal   stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications   programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating   MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance   they'll be downloading MacBinary files.          .image: This format is normally used only for system software,   so that on-line users can download files that can easily be   converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of   using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve   Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on   your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.    MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have   some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.          .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above   table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created   with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be   capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some   unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard   designation for self-extracting archives created with their    payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they    append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.    HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)        By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human   being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a   university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to   give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo   Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,   dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt.    Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.               If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually   asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer    terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of    protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of   StuffIt from a local bulletin board system.              If you have religious objections to software gotten by any    means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that    you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by    far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and    login.  Type the word "binary."  Hit return.  Type "cd   mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.  Then   "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.  Of course   it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt   Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this   fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto   your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will   produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If   you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still   need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make   sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe   is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last   step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals   for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.         HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)         You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable   Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac   without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.   You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as   Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may    terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement    since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going    to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.     (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send    your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering   your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world    of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question   again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh   programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a    Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.    ================================================================= TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0) =================================================================            While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific   problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here.    These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking   for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step   preventative maintenance routine described in section four,   especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system   heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your   problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to   recommend solutions to you.   IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)        "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.  What were you   doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the   crash?  The more information you provide about the actions   preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.    The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions   preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the   following steps fix the problem.  For example, "Sometimes   QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is   not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two   text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already   contain text."  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug   remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the   problem and see if it's still there or not.    READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)        Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and   bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the   manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound   familiar.    CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)        Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus   infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and   they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.    REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)              For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,   improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file   on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This   can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring   from original masters will normally fix this.    REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)          Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file   than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.    See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean   reinstall.              If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these   steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your   application and some other software or a genuine bug in the   program.  So it's time to    ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)              You need to find the minimal system on which the problem   will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the   cause of a system or application crash:         a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do      conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself      without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin      launching other applications until you find the one that causes       the crash.            b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're      running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you       can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially       when performing complicated operations.            c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit      addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile      software out there including some from companies that really       have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?        I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its       incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.            d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears      you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove      extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense      when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs      when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the      Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the      problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,      either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have      a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the      extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the      most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the      conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the      offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make       sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.    CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)        By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why   the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the   software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work   around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the   bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.         ======================   PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)  ======================        You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a   tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot   of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to   charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's   no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step   program should be performed about every three months.     TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)        Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more   smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a   little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,   you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for   applications you no longer have, archives of software you've   dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements   for events that have come and gone and many other files you no   longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several   more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty    the trash.    RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)        Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.    Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension    in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an   extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably   better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes   up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup.    For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no   need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your   extension habit can really help avoid crashes.     REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)        The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary   to associate each file with the application that created it.  It   lets the system know what application should be launched when you   open a given file and what icons it should display where.    Depending on its size each application has one or more   representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files   move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become   bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.    Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with   a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than   to defeat an incumbent.              One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments   you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice   Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments   across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only    if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed.              To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your   extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys.    You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild   the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes."    Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you   have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may   want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.               If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing   preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's   freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the   Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly   corrupt data structures.        ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)        All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950   contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain   settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk   such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this "parameter   RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset   it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys   while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,   Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the   Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter   RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General   Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.              The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the    date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is   notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this   opportunity to reset it anyway.    RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5)         Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most   people still have at least half a row of icons march across the   bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these   extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of   memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough   to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of   it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,   knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and   trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this   fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance   and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.             If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically   resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6   it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage   all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set   to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.    The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot   blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility   BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks   how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much   needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,   use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.    REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)        System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if   you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.    Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file   corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:      1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.       2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out          of your System file into a temporary suitcase.     3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the          Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple          extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be          replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or          installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions,          Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level          of the System Folder.     4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder          is  fine.     5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then          choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your          model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead,          but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't          need that waste your memory and disk space.     6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the          temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System          folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you          forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace          things individually until you find the duplicate piece.      7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.     8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file          that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable          system overall.        DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)        Much like system files hard disks have data structures that   occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even   causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility   for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System   disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in   the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier    version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com   and run it on all your hard disks.                Several companies have released payware disk utilities that   detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid   though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything   that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general   work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's   Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh   2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well   as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do.    For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of   Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features   and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.              All of these products occasionally encounter problems they   can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and   reformat (4.9).        BACKING UP  (4.8)        This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be   done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back   up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies   or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate   from your application and support files then it's easy to only back   up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three   months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.              A number of programs are available to make backing up   easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with   System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup   utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder   onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the   Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup   utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.             Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network   server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should   check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,   doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There   are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD   Backup from System 6.      DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)        As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free   space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the   operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be   stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more   and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several   ways to defragment a hard disk.             The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your   files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while   you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.              A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for   the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.   without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag   about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the   shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before   defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO   freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the   net by asking for one.     REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)        Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a   hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't   need to reformat every three months; but when your system is   crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means   of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even   gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are   created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate   mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3   megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may   vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator   of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not   to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.                Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to   initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software.    Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal   disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY.    Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with   their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat   your hard disk.             A number of general-purpose formatters are also available   which go beyond the bundled software to include features like   encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk   access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the   best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition   ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware   formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones   bundled with your hard disk.              PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and   processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter   what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and   data losses are a very good possibility.

/Yes, a lot of what OS/2 2.0 has in common with OS/2 1.x was written by you /guys. However, many of the things that made OS/2 2.0 so much more successful /(Win-OS/2, Workplace Shell) than previous versions were IBM work.  Yes, certainly.  It was IBM that wrote the Windows code!!!
 I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS (and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too. But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document, calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.  Just a neutral comment: It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that. It's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.
 [edited]    Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.  The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files. And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90% quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 8bit gif!  Later'ish Craig
I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC, it shows up as COM3, with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)!  When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem should be at COM4.  Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3.  To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set, as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as being COM3.  I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help or pointers appreciated.... For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus switching COM ports is not an answer...  (Last time I posted this, I did not get any DOS specific answer, this time I have included all the specific information....please help!)  ----- Avinash Chopde avinash@acm.org

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: 	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 	00196 Rome Italy, 	Piazzale Flaminio, 19 	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in   "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  "Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17. Scientific visualization stuff ==================================  X Data Slice (xds) -------------------   Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT,   in the contrib directory. Available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50]   (either as a source or binaries for various platforms).

For other information contact Doug Norton (e-mail: 74017.461@@compuserve.com)   IRIS Explorer -------------   It's an application creation system developed by Silicon   Graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for   computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.    There are also two FTP servers for related stuff, modules etc.:    ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk [129.215.56.29]   swedishchef.lerc.nasa.gov [139.88.54.33] - mirror of the UK site  apE ---   Back in the 'old good days', you could get apE for nearly free.   Now has gone commercial and the following vendor supplies it:    TaraVisual Corporation   929 Harrison Avenue   Columbus, Ohio 43215   Tel: 1-800-458-8731 and (614) 291-2912   Fax: (614) 291-2867          Cost:   $895 (plus tax); runtime version with a site-license for a single user   (at a time), no limit on the number of machines in a cluster.   $895 includes support/maintenance and upgrades.   Source code more.  Additional user licenses $360.    The name of the package has become apE III (TM).   Khoros is very similar to apE on philosophy, as are AVS and Explorer.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware).

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it"    "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called "GVLware".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI   database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from   a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default   directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different   "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to   contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI "database").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"   in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

Is there a way to use the mouse when running a DOS app (windowed) in win 3.1?  When you window a dos apps (in enhanced mode), I can see where the mouse cursor was, but it doesn't work!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you
 I purchased one personal computer and three for business from them. No  problems. The only time I called tech support was for a minor question  about a video driver and I had no problem getting through.  All four machines seem to be high quality and well made.  A 486dx50 EISA  machine has been our network file server running 24 hrs per day since last  summer with no problems.  I hope this is helpful.
Could anyone tell me the format of GIF files.  I would like to know how I  could determine the size of the picture.  Also, are gif files in compressed format?  How many bits store pixel color information?    (This is probally a simple question, but I couldn't find it in the FAQ.)  email responses would be perferred
  *Sigh*  Don't know what your roomate is doing but it must be something wrong. Are there people who enjoy using Windows? Yes. I'll admit to it. Given a choice between a Mac and Windows I choose Windows every time (to start another flame thread 9-) ) ....      --
Hmmm...   A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks it in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which were sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to track in store piracy.  Possible additional program security schemes would be: 1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in    and registration. (inconvenient) 2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive) 3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness) 4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or    memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc.     (only as effective as above methods at best.) 5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked     copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably    illegal, certainly immoral)  my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thought if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective. What is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what the drawbacks are. I know the companies that make them claim they're uncrackable, but I've seen cracks of AutoDesk 3d-studio floating around (I don't have one so don't ask) and I had heard that it had parralel port keys.
Can anyone provide me a ftp site where I can obtain a online version of the Book of Mormon. Please email the internet address if possible.
I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  It's based on the Cirrus Logic CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer. So if there's a V3.1 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know -  preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz                       Thanks is advance
Does anybody know where I can get a copy of System 6.0.8L.  It is a modified version of System 6 that will work on the newer Mac models.
Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes, most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar file).   Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/... so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and  now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.  I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.  Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun (SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even  tried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.
Does anyone know of any free X-servers for PCs, preferably that run under MS Windows? THANKS.
I am looking for an available program that would convert gif files to other formats usable on DOS-based software such as WordPerfect Presentations (which will handle .wpg and .tiff, among others).    Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you very much for your time and help.  Steve alford@novavax.nova.edu

    I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that    will do compositing of a series of pictures?     What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip    (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated    bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of    pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want    the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this    with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do    manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at    a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to    composite a series of frames would be even better.     I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform    this.  Help, please!  If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color "clear", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work.

Despite its small size and quickness,   it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:   standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,   mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each   graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four   different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and   other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.   Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),   including a portable metafile format and renderer.      Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on   hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot      At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:      Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix   Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT      Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.    Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000   fax: 217 355 8925  NIH IMAGE ---------   Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)   zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.   It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  Video-rate   capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution   monochromatic and color images.  Includes C source code."  TCL-Image:   "Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and   analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,   and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.   TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF."    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   "An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting."    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don't know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters, and interpret the data."    Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose."    "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software."    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Its for IBM PC's or   clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual"  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called "Imagine32"   or "Image32" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,   subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.

SOFTWARE TOOLS --------------   It's a set of software "tools" put out by Canyon State   Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I   heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that   difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image.

Recently, Windows has starting giving me the error "Sound Blaster Pro: Requires newer version of Windows 3.1."  It has worked correctly for a long time, and don't know what the problem could be.  Thanks!   --
Hello.       I have Windows 3.1 and I was wondering what is necessary to change the default system font to something else.  I have just obtained MSC/C++ 7.0 with SDK, so I'd really like to get my feet wet with doing my first windows pro- gram to change the system font.  Tx.,  William F. Maton
Hey guys! I run twm and would like to execute some program before leaving twm. In other words I would like to run some program before I do f.quit. Is it possible to make a menu section which would contain these two parts?
   Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:    In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If that was not what you meant, then:   Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry if I misunderstood.   Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road,  Manchester, UK.

Greetings,   I need some help with the detail of geometry specification.  I have a program that uses Xlib to create a simple window.  I tried to hard code the x,y location in XCreateWindow but it didn't work.  I also tried XSetStandardProperties, XSetWMHints with no luck.  Could somebody enlighten me on this subject.  Hans.

Personally I run Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win version froever... :) ), but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule: I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for:  1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF _always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading 3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn' --it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced.. These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win.., :) Hope it helps somehow...

FOR SALE:  AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem  The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems.  It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).  They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible.  These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.  They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).  I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is backed by a company that will never go away.  This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.)  If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.  If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at  (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.  The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.
Hi!  We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from  whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps something else ?  The question is, where can I find some information about this language ? A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?  (OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT optimistic...)  Thanks in advance for any help!  	jussi

hi netters,  	I'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  Firstly, I have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display on various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.  	Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed in 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images which I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they are using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them under X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the GUI by X-windows for our project   	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or query above?  Or, give me some advice or suggestion where I can find them out.   	Please send me an e-mail if there are any.  Thanks in advance.    						Yours 			 						Christine Chan
  You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember  4DOS and NDOS?  I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything  from R1.0.  Microsoft has other projects to work on.   I don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it  IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on top of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With  XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna  need a fast processor.  [Re: DOS's death]  Except for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of  the business world.
I think a few things are being missed overall here... First of all, anyone with a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off of a hard disk. 'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks. They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to computer games.       Those people are in the minority, however. In my experience with the world of people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will at some point copy a friend's program ("Gee, you really oughta try this") or accept a copy. These are people who normally would buy a software package or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter.  The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one  computer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * X# of computers for the same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially things like DOS upgrades.
 It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to  challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because of the high prices for good Unix software.
Can I view JPEG files without special hardware?
I'm told that I can replace the colorful windows logo that appears as windows invokes with a graphic of my choosing.  The challange is that the image must be in 'RLE' format.  I've got GIF's, PIC's, JPG's, TIF's, etc... everything but RLE's!  What's the best route to converting these things?   What program should I download, and from where?   Has anybody else done this, and do you have the steps available?
Hello,   Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications.  We are trying to use action translation tables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application.  The Xt calls we make are included below.  It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations, and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

XtAddActions(actionsTable, XtNumber(actionsTable));     trans_table = XtParseTranslationTable(defaultTranslations);      widget = XtCreateManagedWidget("msg", xmPushButtonWidgetClass, 		form, wargs, n);      XtOverrideTranslations(widget, trans_table);
 I think you would need a DOS macro program.  Superkey (by Borland?) comes to mind.  I don't think Windows is capable of sending keystrokes to a DOS window.  What you want to do sounds like a security problem to me, though.
We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have used Xvision on a PC, setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then manage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86 running under Linux, but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux  (let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision.  Can anybody help? Thanks,
Yeah... and BMW 525e has 2.7 litres 		535      3.4   BTW - can someone out there please tell me how to put someone else's file  on and then reply to that so the other person's file and my own 'reply' go to the newgroups together? (ps: just mail me personally)
I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using  my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript  laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been  fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do  some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might  not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to  2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore.   The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a  rather important font :-)   I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the  [Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't  work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files  generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I  manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file  everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs  to work with.   And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are  listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts.  Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works  well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows  applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well.   Has anyone encountered problems like this?   What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1  Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?  I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

   The problem is that QuinZip is very very slow.  So I think that WinZip 4.0 is still the best choice to use pkzip in Windows!
 I hate to disagree, but I will. :) (note: I don't pirate software, nor do I trade it. I simply have met and talked extensively with those who have. that's it. the FBI can tap someone else's phone :) Most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate. A cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s).  I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving' copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use on one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?  It's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since "someone's already paid for it", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much though.)   what about commercially available copy programs? CopyII? how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't? and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldn't know about this:   after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that the 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least 200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who are doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few arguments to the dir command.   really? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster, but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you jump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too!  But I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written down.   what if they need to re-install? The idea of a backup still holds- if the original disk goes bad, they're out of luck for about 1-2 weeks, which is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks- if they'll do it without a charge.
Hi folks,  I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0, and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!) Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the  Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the  Makefile reads      # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!  Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README file.)  Email and post are both fine.  Thanks in advance,

  Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3D modelling packages.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1. Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being executed from the DOS directory.  Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not, I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE (which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in  about 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more realistic volume of data to time.

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the document at 600 dots per inch resolution.  I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from an image processing program that can output images in Postscript.  Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv) doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.  Any ideas?

 I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command (a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:    "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if   you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for   Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives   from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use   JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1."  Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been "mounted" using join.  In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.  Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone.  I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to  reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw DOS.  So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like.  Wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately, JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.  It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant  users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.
I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not  specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he  has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to  print the forms properly.  This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported  dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not  the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction  of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.  Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?   Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable  cost?  Any suggestions would be welcome.

I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,    an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.    Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-     gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).   SUPPORTED FORMATS       o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS       o  JPEG(JFIF) format       o  CompuServ GIF       o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.       o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)       o  TIFF       o  PostScript(Write only)  Hardware requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------    Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.  Where to get it: ---------------------------------------------------------------    anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z    where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73     Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking  Acknowledgement: ---------------------------------------------------------------    JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.    FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.    Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.  ---------------------------------------------------------------   Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it   (and you will like it).
After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have,  however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like,  once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.
I would like to prevent our Windows users from using ctl-alt-del from within windows. I know there must be a way to do it. Could anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance, Mike Glynn mike.glynn@business.gatech.edu
 You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh, sh, etc...)   This is true.   A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif? Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing down our throats for some time now...)  The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users running windows (all flavors) and the other "power" users running Unix and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it too.
 It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources.  For example, open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources with ndw 2.x as shell,   then do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the apps.
    You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising.  I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10).  The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you  do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped.  As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.  As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else  than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.  Michael
In fact, I'm looking for a possibility to connect different peaces of information (like in the windows help system).   And no, I don't want to program such a system by myself. The necessary effort and afford should be as small as possible.
** I am posting this for a friend ** ** please respond to vaughn%sonatech@hub.ucsb.edu **  I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern  and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern  of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width  is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the  pattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even  multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels  apart.   extern	Display	       *dpy; extern	Window		xid; extern	GC		gc;  extern	int	Max_X, Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/  dither(pixels)  	char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/  	{ 	char	*bm;			/* bitmap data			*/ 	char    *bmp; 	long	 I, arraymax;   	arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y;  	bm  = (char *)malloc(arraymax); 	bmp = bm;  	for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++) 		{ 		if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT) 			*bmp |=   2<<j;		/* pixel on		*/ 		else 			*bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/  		if (++j > 7) 			{ 			bmp++; 			j = 0; 			} 		}  	stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y); 	free(bm);  	XClearWindow(dpy, xid);  	XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple); 	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled); 	XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y); 	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid); 	}  I suspect the answer is to pad the data.
I am working with 24 bit RGB BMP files and need to comvert these to 15 and 16 bit images. How do convert 24 bit images to 15 and 16 bit RGB images? Thanks!
 	What I saw on TV and what you claim are two different things. The Davidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.   	EASY! If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns going in throught windows, that is a No-Knock warrant. Also since the  videotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BD's etunred fire,  you can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell.   P.Vasilion,
 That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do. IMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as possible AND to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain-deads) , quick reference books, how to do books and videos, paid support hot line (1-900 :).  For the registered purchasers, these can be part of their package. I have seen many books to teach people how to use DOS, WP and other software.  I I suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals. Either way, there is $$$ to be made.   BTW books are quite a bit more expensive to reproduce than a $1 disk.   With the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems (eg. OS0.5, Windoze, Mack System 7), it is pretty easy to run a debugger and figure out the protection schemes by disassembling/tracing/trapping the application during run time.  Schemes like compressed software/ special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.  Hardware keys (unless well designed and *TOTALLY* transparent) is a pain in the b*t.  We having using a piece of software under Windoze that uses a hardware key.  The key interfers with the printer stuff with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software to work properly.   All the hacker has to do is to remove/modify code that communicate with the port.
Has anyone got an active filter design program that runs on an IBM PC ??  Something that will easily let me specify bandpass filter parameters, and it will give me the appropriate component values ??  It has to be public domain,  if anyone has one, could you mail it to me.  Thanks in advance,  Scott u9035710@wraith.cs.uow.edu.au
I need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of the file to be displayed, then just display that image and then quit.  All of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some other silliness.  This program is going to be run from within another program.  I have lots of memory and VGA color.  Any graphics format will do.  Has anyone heard of such a beast?  					Keith
Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!!  Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?   Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?
Hi: On the 1024x768x256 mode, the font sizes of Window Menu, Help Window are very  small. Can I change the font and font size for these windows? My computer is  80486 DX-33, the Video Card is ATI D24. Could some experts please email the  answer to GRZHENG@vax2.Concondia.ca. Thanks in advance.
Does any one out there have experience with Planet X, I am considering buying it to use on a SPARCstation IPC, in this way I can run Mac programs from the SPARC.  Would you recommend buying this piece of Software and what is the emulation on the SPARC like?  Does it give a window of a Mac or does it give a window of just the individual programs?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Dean

I'd like to get a system running OS/2 2.0 GA talking to a network of PCs running Windows for Workgroups.  Acting as a server would be wonderful, but client access would be enough.  Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box?  Or is there a way to actually get OS/2 to talk to WFW?  Will OS/2 LanMan clients talk to WFW?  Dazed and confused,
      Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally unsuitable for my needs.  Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias in the copy of the faq that I have.
Hi!  	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver.  What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call xlock program.  	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a way to find out how long the server has been idle?
This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:    I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0, which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.  My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions:  static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; {    /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */   if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { 		nextSetLastEventTime();   }    if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ 		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); 		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */   }   else {											 /* Unblank the screen */ 		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);   }    return TRUE; }  I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the screen.  Any tips/help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
       WHAT??!!!!  You can't remove it, unless you register?   You gotta be joking, right? What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!) If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!   A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like.  Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.   As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: Limit the size of data that the program can work with, Disable saving the data, Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited  etc.... but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.
A while ago there was a reference to a paper on a crypto file system (CFS) given by someone at at AT&T (?).   How can I get a copy?   Is it available on the net?   Was it published? Who was the author?     Thanks
*** On 04-21-93  04:30, Michael Shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this:   MS> The DOS system date has a twenty-four hour clock and a rollover bit.  MS> When the system crosses midnight, the rollover bit is turned on.    MS> Subsequent reads of the time add one.  There's no change possible   MS> (This information was current up through DOS 3.3.  I've not checked to  MS> see whether it applies to later versions.)  Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added a small "feature" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value. This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.  Sometimes the Microsoft people just don't think! :)  ...

Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System -------------------  If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this...  // mini sample application /////////////////////////////////////  class Test : public XmWindow { 	void cmd(char*); 	void quit(void*); public:     Test() : XmWindow("Xm++ Test Window") {}  	void initialize(); };  void Test::initialize() {     XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu();      menu->addLabel("&File");     menu->addItems( Entry("Menu Item &One", CB(Test::cmd)),                      Entry("Menu Item &Two", CB(Test::cmd)),                     NULLENTRY);     menu->addSeparator();     menu->addItem(	Entry("E&xit", CB(Test::quit)));      addSubpane(Edit, "myEdit");     edit("myEdit")->setText("Hello World."); }  void Test::cmd(char* n) { 	edit("myEdit")->setText(n); }  void Test::quit(void*) { 	exit(0); }  void XmApp::initialize() {     (new Test)->initialize(); }  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README):  Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes, although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases.  Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version, which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).  Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout   feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface   builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this   distribution)  Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton', 'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'  The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.  Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.   CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices). If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.   About this first release:  Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.  Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on:   HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07   SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1   PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6  Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

  Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or  create a temp. DOS window?  If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid  I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.  It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.  Later,  Phil Trodwell
I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of   the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to    include in a manual.    I have tried:    xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd     from a login on a remote terminal, but it doesn't work.    Xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window   server doesn't answer.     Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to   ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.    Thanks in advance                                            Nadia Pitacco  --
I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).  I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?  Any help would be immensely appreciated!
  I'm also interested in such a program. But most of all I'd like to know  wich program is able to convert GIF or PCX to DXF !!! When I have this  program, I can scan pictures and frase (or something like that !) them. This will be beyond the limit !!!

I have gotten X11R5 pl 23 to compile on AIX 3.2.2 using cc.  but the server will not run. it simplys starts and a couple seconds  later exits. no error are displayed.   my defines for compile are  -DSYSV -DAIXV3 -DSYSV_WAIT   -DMALLOC_0_RETURNS_NULL        could somewhere share some light, or maybe the ibm.cf file.    thanks.
I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means virtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along with expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too.  Does anyone out there have EMM code.  Can any point me to an EMM code source?  -Thanks, Morgan
I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File Manager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the file."  Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM (yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells me that the file is already expanded.  All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying to execute a DOS program from Windows.
I need to know where I can get a FAQ on Xwindows for MS-DOS machines. The usual FAQ just gave me a name of a file called XServers-NonUNIX.txt.Z. which I cannot find anywhere.
I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI) file to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound, it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC file. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs using Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the GIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and save it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.  Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.            Thanks              Don
I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed the appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly.    What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts.    When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change  the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.   I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates, namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.   If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most  chuffed.

  	Build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for  	instance, if you have Crystal Fonts enabled.  Some other problems--	 	"color darkening" and some others.  I don't use the drivers in  	any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the 	other modes I can't say.     	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the  	Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.  	That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click 	shading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern 	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list 	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take 	it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or 	print it and iy shows--badly!    	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't 	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty  	solid.  --  	"What's big, noisy and has an IQ of 8?"
Hi, folks,  I have a question:          How can I generate a PCX file using Word for Windows (2.0) ?  I know I can select a Postscript printer driver to get a PS file, but how can I generate a PCX file ? Is there a printer capture utility for windows that ever exists ? Or a utility to transfer PS format to PCX format, or TIFF format?  Please reply by E-MAIL, I will give a summary. Thanks.
Has anyone seen hallusions?  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture.  I'm looking for a program that generates these pictures.  There's a company in Texas that makes them but I  doubt if they're giving the program away.  Any help would be appreciated.
Sorry, I've lost track of who asked the question originally  	(our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendously 	short periods of time), but wanted to be certain before I 	replied. Someone asked about displaying the compressed images 	from the Voyager imaging CD-ROMs on a Mac. As Peter Ford (MIT) 	pointed out, a decompression program is available via FTP. 	(Sorry, I don't remember the name of the node offhand,  	although it's .mit.edu.) In any case, though, one of the MAC 	display programs (CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift) does display 	the compressed images directly. The program is shareware and 	is distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs ($9 + 	shipping, if memory serves). This does *not* cover the 	shareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent work 	and upgrades, however.

 Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason,  ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.   Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion. I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a  thought.
Hi there,     Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event to another window but it MUST appear in that window....  I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!  For example, if I get a program executing:  -------------- #!/bin/sh read something .... .... echo $something .... .... --------------  and if I send the key event "<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a" to that window then I will get:  something=a   Thanks in advance.   --
      Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality  when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely installed" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the  fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To software, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager  plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.  Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.
